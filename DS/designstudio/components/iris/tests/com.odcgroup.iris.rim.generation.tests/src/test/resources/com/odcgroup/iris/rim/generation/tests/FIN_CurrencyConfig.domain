	/* CCY.HISTORY is a new 'L'ive type file containing the effective dates of currency rate changes for any currency for any year.  The file also holds the currency file current number at the effective date.
To achieve the implementation of this file at existing sites the BLD.CURRENCY.HIS routine is used to build complete records in the CURRENCY$HIS file, and the BLD.CCY.HISTORY routine is used to build CCY.HISTORY records from the CURRENCY$HIS file.
The CCY.HISTORY file is maintained by the EOD.CCY.HISTORY routine in CCY.CYCLE.DATA at end of day.  Complete CURRENCY file recors will be maintained by the AUTH.RECORD.WRITE routine.
In addition there is a GET.CCY.HISTORY routine that will obtain the required currency record from a date and currency code.

	/* This table contains all details of each individual Currency, for example, Currency Name, Number of Decimal places together with other information such as the Buy and Sell Rates.
T24 caters for both Middle rate and Buy/Sell Rate environments therefore when installing the System the User must specify, in the Company record, which method is to be adopted.  Regardless of which rates are entered, however, both Middle and Buy/Sell Rates are used in calculations e.g.
-          Middle Rate is used for monitoring of rate variances; -          Buy/Sell Rates are used (in conjunction with spreads) to            calculate Treasury/Customer rates.
Automatically, when the Middle Rate and the Default Spread are entered, the Buy/Sell Rates are calculated and when Buy/Sell Rates are input the Middle Rate and the Default spread will be calculated by the System.
The use of the I.S.O. Currency Codes are recommended as a standard for the ID of this table although an additional numeric code must be defined and may be used as an alternative ID for accessing the Currency details.
Up to 999 additional elements may be defined according to local requirements.
To assist the user, we are including below explanations of the two methods used to quote exchange rates.
1) The first method is used in countries where the local currency is being    quoted and the foreign currency is the variable amount.  This is the    practice followed in U.K. where the GBP/USD quotation, for example,    will be expressed as 1.2500 and not as 0.8000.  This case will be    referred to as UK type environment.
2) The second method is used in countries where the foreign currency is    being quoted and the local currency is the variable amount.  This is    the practice followed by Europe, for example, in France, the USD/FRF    quotation will be expressed as 8.7500 and not as 0.1143.  This case    will be referred to as Non-UK type environment.
It must be noted that the words BUY and SELL used in the various examples always denotes the action of the bank (e.g.  CUSTOMER BUY RATE will mean the rate at which the bank is buying the Currency from the Customer).
UK TYPE ENVIRONMENT ===================
Middle Rate System ------------------
INPUT      : MIDDLE RATE and DEFAULT SPREAD CALCULATED : BUY RATE  = (Middle + Default Spread)              SELL RATE = (Middle - Default Spread)

Buy/Sell Rate System --------------------
INPUT      : BUY RATE and SELL RATE CALCULATED : MIDDLE RATE    = (Buy + Sell/2)            : DEFAULT SPREAD = (Middle - Sell)
Note : In this environment, the BUY RATE will be GREATER than the SELL        RATE.
Example : If you are in London, the Deutsche Mark and French Francs           quotations will be:
BUY RATE             SELL RATE           --------             ---------           DEM  3.8820            3.8780           FRF 11.4500           11.3500

NON-UK TYPE ENVIRONMENT =======================
Middle Rate System ------------------
INPUT      : MIDDLE RATE and DEFAULT SPREAD CALCULATED : BUY RATE  = (Middle - Default Spread)            : SELL RATE = (Middle + Default Spread)

Buy/Sell Rate System --------------------
INPUT      : BUY RATE and SELL RATE CALCULATED : MIDDLE RATE    = (Buy + Sell)/2            : DEFAULT SPREAD = (Sell - Middle)
Note : In this environment, the BUY RATE will be LESS than the SELL RATE.
Example :
In Germany, the American dollar and the Pound Sterling quotations will look like:
BUY RATE             SELL RATE           --------             ---------           USD 3.0880             3.0920           GBP 3.8600             3.8650
Each Currency record caters for different Currency Markets thereby providing up to 9 different rate structures.  This facility can be utilised when physical markets exist, e.g.  Financial and Convertible Markets or where pricing considerations require differing rates or spreads (e.g.  Transfers/Notes/Travellers cheques).  For the examples in this Overview only one Currency Market has been used.
For each Currency the user can specify a Negotiable Amount, i.e.  an amount, above which, the Treasury rate must be obtained from the dealer.
Treasury and Customer Spreads will be defaulted from the CURRENCY record unless a specific rate and spread is input on the Transaction.  Where only a rate is input (this will be taken as the Treasury Rate) the default Customer Spread will be added/subtracted to obtain the Customer Rate.
Where only a Customer Spread is input on the Transaction the System will default the Treasury Rate.
Note : Each Module, e.g.  FOREIGN EXCHANGE, FUNDS TRANSFER or DATA.CAPTURE        will define whether rates input are treated as Treasury or Customer        Rates and whether input of a rate is compulsory for Transactions        in excess of the Negotiable Amount.
The Treasury Buy/Sell rates are the rates at which Treasury units buy/sell foreign currency from/to the Marketing units.
The Exchange rates quoted to Customers are determined by Marketing units by defining the appropriate Customer Spread to be added/subtracted to/from the Treasury Buy/Sell Rates.  (Refer to following examples)
i)  UK Type Environment - Currency Rate Concept     -------------------
MARKET BUY RATE                    MARKET SELL RATE                 (+)     plus/minus     (-)                       TREASURY SPREAD                           equals
TREASURY BUY RATE                  TREASURY SELL RATE                   (+)   plus/minus     (-)                       CUSTOMER SPREAD                           equals
CUSTOMER BUY RATE                  CUSTOMER SELL RATE
Example : DEFAULT RATE CALCULATION (UK-GBP/USD) -               MARKET MIDDLE RATE = 1.2500               MARKET DEFAULT SPREAD = 0.0015
MARKET BUY RATE = 1.2515           MARKET SELL RATE = 1.2485                       TREASURY SPREAD = 0.0050
TREASURY BUY RATE = 1.2565         TREASURY SELL RATE = 1.2435                       CUSTOMER SPREAD = 0.0100
CUSTOMER BUY RATE = 1.2665         CUSTOMER SELL RATE = 1.2335
Note : In the UK type environment, the BUY RATES are GREATER than the            SELL RATES.

ii) Non-UK Type Environment - Currency Rate Concept     -----------------------
MARKET BUY RATE                    MARKET SELL RATE                 (-)     minus/plus     (+)                       TREASURY SPREAD                            equals
TREASURY BUY RATE                  TREASURY SELL RATE                   (-)   minus/plus     (+)                       CUSTOMER SPREAD                            equals
CUSTOMER BUY RATE                  CUSTOMER SELL RATE
Example : DEFAULT RATE CALCULATION (Germany-USD/DEM)               MARKET MIDDLE RATE = 3.09               MARKET DEFAULT SPREAD = 0.0030
MARKET BUY RATE = 3.0870           MARKET SELL RATE = 3.0930                       TREASURY SPREAD = 0.0100
TREASURY BUY RATE = 3.0770         TREASURY SELL RATE = 3.1030                       CUSTOMER SPREAD = 0.0125
CUSTOMER BUY RATE = 3.0645         CUSTOMER SELL RATE = 3.1155
Note : In the Non-UK type environment, the BUY RATES are LESS than the            SELL RATES.

Allocation of Exchange Profit -----------------------------
As mentioned earlier, the final exchange rates quoted to Customers (Customer Buy Rate and Sell Rate) are determined by Marketing units by defining the appropriate Customer spread (Customer Small Spread and Medium Spread) to be added/subtracted to/from the Treasury Buy/Sell Rates.
The allocation of exchange earnings is then made automatically between Treasury and Marketing units at the time of the deal/transaction in that any profit relating to the Marketing area (Customer Spread) is credited to Profit or Loss immediately and the deal is effectively booked at Treasury Buy/Sell Rates.  All exchange profit or loss on revaluation therefore accrues to the Treasury area.
To assist the user, various examples follow to illustrate the allocation of the Foreign Exchange Profit between the Marketing and the Treasury areas.  The first example illustrates a transaction where the local currency is involved.  The second and third examples depict transactions where both currencies are foreign.
Note : The examples reflect the method of quoting rates in the UK, i.e.        where the local currency is the currency being quoted.  For        countries where the foreign currency is the currency being        quoted, the Buy and Sell Rates are interchanged.

ALLOCATION (FGN/LOCAL) ======================
EXAMPLE 1 - Buy FCY from a customer against local CCY -----------------------------------------------------
i.e.  CUSTOMER SELLS $1000.00 AGAINST LCY
DR CASH $1000.00 at 1.2565 (Treasury Rate) = LCY 795.86 CR CUST $1000.00 at 1.2665 (Customer Rate) = LCY 789.58 CR P+L (Being CUSTOMER SPREAD OF 0.01)       LCY   6.28
The Customer will thus receive 789.58 against the USD 1,000.00 and the marketing profit on the transaction is GBP 6.28.

EXAMPLE 2 - Sell FCY to a customer against local CCY ----------------------------------------------------
i.e.  CUSTOMER BUYS $1000.00 AGAINST LCY
CR CASH $1000.00 at 1.2435 (Treasury Rate) = LCY 804.18 DR CUST $1000.00 at 1.2335 (Customer Rate) = LCY 810.70 CR P+L (Being CUSTOMER SPREAD of 0.01)       LCY   6.52
The Customer will have to pay GBP 810.70 to buy USD 1,000.00 and the marketing profit on the transaction is GBP 6.52.

MARKETING EXCHANGE PROFIT ALLOCATION (FGN/FGN) ============================================== (Buy FCY from a customer against another FCY)
On transactions involving two foreign currencies, the System will automatically take the spread on the currency which is NOT the "BASE" currency (the default base currency being the currency which yields a cross rate greater than "1").
For the "BASE" currency, the System will then take the Middle Rate. The user has, however, the facility to specify the base currency if he does not want to the System to work on the default value. Examples of these options follow.  In Example 3 the "default base currency" is "DEM".  This is because its value is greater than "FRF".
EXAMPLE 2 - Base Currency = DEM (Default) -----------------------------------------             (Customer sells FRF 6000.00 against DEM)
DR CASH FRF 6000.00 at 11.50 (Treasury Rate) = LCY 521.74 CR CUST DEM 2006.40 at 3.8625 (Middle Rate)  = LCY 519.48 CR PROFIT AND LOSS                           = LCY   2.26
CROSS RATE = 2.9903
The Customer will thus receive DEM 2,006.40 against the FRF 6,000.00 and the marketing profit on the transaction is GBP 2.26.
The accounting entries shown represent the result of this Transaction and the actual sequence of events is detailed hereafter.
STEP 1 : CALCULATE CUSTOMER BUY RATE FOR FRF AGAINST LCY             MARKET MIDDLE RATE = 11.4000             MARKET DEFAULT SPREAD = 0.05
MARKET BUY RATE = 11.4500   MARKET SELL RATE = 11.3500                 TREASURY SPREAD = 0.05
TREASURY BUY RATE = 11.5000 TREASURY SELL RATE = 11.3000                 CUSTOMER SPREAD = 0.05
CUSTOMER BUY RATE = 11.5500 CUSTOMER SELL RATE = 11.2500
Therefore customer FRF Buy Rate = 11.5500

STEP 2 : OBTAIN DEM MIDDLE RATE AGAINST LCY
DEM Middle Rate = 3.8625                     (i.e. 3.09 * 1.25)

STEP 3 : CALCULATE CROSS RATES
CUSTOMER CROSS RATE = (11.55/3.8625) = 2.9903          TREASURY CROSS RATE = (11.50/3.8625) = 2.977346
Note : This time, the exchange cross rates are expressed as French        Franc per Deutsche Mark because the DEM has been specified        as the base currency.

STEP 4 : CALCULATE DEM EQUIVALENTS
FRF 6000.00 at 2.9903 (Customer Rate) = DEM 2006.40          FRF 6000.00 at 2.9773 (Treasury Rate) = DEM 2015.22

STEP 5 : EFFECTIVE RESULT
DR CASH FRF 6000.00 at 11.50   = LCY 521.74          CR CUST DEM 2006.49 at  3.8625 = LCY 519.48          CR P+L (DEM 8.73 at 3.8625)    = LCY 2.26          (i.e. the difference)

EXAMPLE 4 - Base Currency = FRF (specified by the user) -------------------------------------------------------
(Customer sells DEM 6,000.00 against FRF)
DR CASH DEM  6000.00 at 3.8965 (Treasury Rate) = LCY 1539.84 CR CUST FRF 17478.00 at 11.40  (Middle Rate)   = LCY 1533.16 CR PROFIT AND LOSS                             = LCY    6.68
CROSS RATE = 3.343289
The Customer will thus receive FRF 17,478.00 against the DEM 6,000.00 and the marketing profit on the transaction is LCY 6.68.
The accounting entries shown represent the result of this transaction and the actual sequence of events is detailed hereafter.

STEP 1 : CALCULATE CUSTOMER BUY RATE FOR DEM AGAINST LCY
MARKET MIDDLE RATE = 3.8625          MARKET DEFAULT SPREAD = 0.0170
MARKET BUY RATE = 3.8795       MARKET SELL RATE = 3.8455                   TREASURY SPREAD = 0.0170
TREASURY BUY RATE = 3.8965     TREASURY SELL RATE = 3.8285                   CUSTOMER SPREAD = 0.0170
CUSTOMER BUY RATE = 3.9135     CUSTOMER SELL RATE = 3.8115
Therefore Customer DEM BUY RATE = 3.9135

STEP 2 : OBTAIN FRF MIDDLE RATE AGAINST LCY
FRF Middle Rate = 11.4000

STEP 3 : CALCULATE CROSS RATE
CUSTOMER CROSS RATE = (3.9135/11.40) = 0.343289 TREASURY CROSS RATE = (3.8965/11.40) = 0.3417985
Note : The exchange Cross Rates are expressed as Deutsche Mark per        French Franc because FRF has been selected as the base        currency.

STEP 4 : CALCULATE FRF EQUIVALENTS
DEM 6000.00 at 0.3432 (Customer Rate) = FRF 17478.00 DEM 6000.00 at 0.3417 (Treasury Rate) = FRF 17554.20

STEP 5 : EFFECTIVE RESULT
DR CASH DEM  6000.00 at  3.8965 = LCY 1539.84 CR CUST FRF 17478.00 at 11.40   = LCY 1533.16 CR P+L    (FRF 76.20 at 11.40)  = LCY    6.68 */

		/* Identifies the method of quotation of the exchange rate.
Market practice makes use of two basic methods for organising the quotation of Currencies:
1. UK Type Environment    The first method of exchange rate quotation refers to those countries    where the local currency is the Currency being quoted and the foreign    currency is the variable amount.  In U.K., for example, the exchange    rates will always be expressed against the Pound Sterling (their local    currency).
2. Non-UK Type Environment    The second method of exchange rate quotation refers to those countries    where the foreign currency is the Currency being quoted and the local    Currency is the variable amount.  In Germany, for example, the exchange    rates will always be expressed against the foreign currency (e.g. 1 USD    = 2,98 DEM; 1 GBP = 3,8625 DEM etc...).  As a further requirement, in    this environment, it must be possible to indicate the number of units    of the foreign currency which is used to express the exchange rate.
In Belgium, the US dollar or the Pound Sterling exchange rates will be    expressed in single unit (i.e. 1 USD = 60 BEF or 1 GBP = 80 BEF) while    for smaller value currencies like the Italian Lira and the Japanese    Yen, the  exchange    rates will be expressed in  100 units (i.e. 100    ITL = 3 BEF or 100 JPY = 24 BEF).
Therefore, for this environment, this FIELD allows you to define this    number of units as details in the following table:
Value                  Meaning
0                            1        UNIT of the foreign currency 1                           10        UNITS           "       " 2                          100       UNITS           "       " 3                         1000      UNITS           "       " 4                        10000      UNITS           "       " 5                       100000      UNITS           "       "
Example: If you are in Belgium you will define for:
Currency   Quotation Code
USD        0    GBP        0    DEM        0    ITL        2    JPY        2    etc.
Great care must be taken by the user when defining the value of this field, because all the exchange rates quoted against the local currency will take this value into account in currency conversion and verification.  When a cross-rate is quoted between two foreign currencies, a direct rate will be expressed irrespective of the quotation code on either currency. A similar cross-rate will, therefore, apply in both the UK and non-UK type environment.

		/* Specifies the decimal displacement of a PIP when the Currency is quoted against US dollars or Pounds sterling.
The Foreign Exchange Application allows for exchange rates to be input as (+/-) a number of pips when one of the Currencies of the transaction is USD or GBP.  These pips (premium/discount) will then be added to/subtracted from a datum rate (e.g. the number of PIPS defined on the forward leg of a SWAP contract will be added to/subtracted from the SPOT rate entered in the spot leg).  This field defines the decimal displacement, and therefore the value, of 1 PIP when dealing against US dollars or Pounds Sterling.
Example:
The dealer makes a SWAP contract USD/DEM by which he is buying SPOT US dollars at 2.9675 against Deutsche Marks and selling 3 months FORWARD US Dollars against Deutsche Marks at a discount of 300 PIPS.
If the DEM Currency has been defined with the value of 4 in the field Quotation PIPS, the System will then convert the discount of 300 PIPS with a 4 decimal displacement as follows:
INPUT     RESULT            SPOT LEG     2.9675    2.9675            FWD LEG       - 300   - 0.0300            FWD RATE               2.9375
In consequence adding or subtracting 300 PIPS is equivalent to adding or subtracting 0.0300 when the quotation PIPS of the currency is 4.
Note : (i) It has been assumed that the quotation PIPS of any Currency is            the same against US Dollars and Pound Sterling.  This is a true            statement today but should this practice change, an appropriate            maintenance will then be required in this field.

The actual value is defined in the CURRENCY.PARAM record for this currency.
Each currency can optionally be assigned a unique base currency rank in the same manner as currency rank. The values are stored in the application RANK.BASE.CURRENCY.
If two currencies are involved in a conversion and both have a base ccy rank defined then the currency with the lowest rank will take preference.
N.B. It has been stated that rates to the EURO (EUR) will always be quoted      as the number of other currency units to 1 EUR, even when 1 unit of      the other currency is worth more than 1 EUR.
Example : assuming that 0.71 GBP were worth 1 EUR then the effect of not           supplying a base currency or rate to the conversion routine           would result in the base currency being set to GBP and the rate           expressed as the inverse of 0.71 i.e 1.408451.
Setting the EUR to have a base currency rank of 1 would result in the EUR being the base currency and the rate to be 0.71.
Great care should be taken when defining a currency to have a base currency rank. There are in fact very few instances where this should be used. One example as discussed is the EURO. Another example would relate to the Irish punt in a situation where the local currency has been converted to be the Euro.
Market practice in Ireland is to quote all foreign currencies to 1 unit of local including GBP, so for example GBP in Ireland will be quoted as say 0.8 GBP to 1 IEP, with EUR as local currency the system will default the rate to be the inverse of this i.e 1.25 IEP to 1 GBP. To retain the current market practice with EUR as the local currency then EUR should be defined with the lowest rank and IEP with the second lowest rank.
This siuation may also apply when converting from a GBP local currency to EUR.

All Transaction Processing Applications contain a data element Currency Market and any input made in this field will be checked against this table to derive or verify the appropriate exchange rate of the transaction.  The exchange rates applicable to the Market 1 will always be defaulted if no other input has been done.
For the local currency input in this FIELD will also be allowed to permit the user to use, if required, the fields Quotation Suspense and Negotiable Amount.  These are the only 2 fields of the association which will be allowed for the local currency.
A typical example is Belgium where foreign currencies are quoted on the Convertible/Regular market and also on the Financial/Free market. Different sets of exchange rates will exist according to these two markets and this explains the reason and the purpose of this field.
The CURRENCY table allows you to identify, if required, up to nine different markets and consequently to define for each foreign currency up to nine different sets of exchange rates.  The System will always force you to define at least one set of rates, i.e. to define the exchange rates applicable to the currency Market 1 which will be the default currency Market used by all Transaction processing applications.
It must also be noted that this CURRENCY.MARKET field can also be used within the concept of notional market, i.e. where you would like to define different sets of exchange rates according to the type of product handled. One set of exchange rates, for example, could be defined to identify the exchange rates applicable to your Notes transactions, set of rates for travellers cheques, another set of rates for your transfer transactions, etc.
Validation Rules:

Each currency can optionally be assigned a unique base currency rank in the same manner as currency rank. The values are stored in the application RANK.BASE.CURRENCY.
If two currencies are involved in a conversion and both have a base ccy rank defined then the currency with the lowest rank will take preference.
N.B. It has been stated that rates to the EURO (EUR) will always be quoted      as the number of other currency units to 1 EUR, even when 1 unit of      the other currency is worth more than 1 EUR.
For example assuming that 0.71 GBP were worth 1 EUR then the effect of not supplying a base currency or rate to the conversion routine would result in the base currency being set to GBP and the rate  expressed as the inverse of 0.71 i.e 1.408451.
Setting the EUR to have a base currency rank of 1 would result in the EUR being the base currency and the rate to be 0.71.
Great care should be taken when setting the currency rank, there are very few instances where a rank needs to be set, for example the EURO as described.
Another example would be a local currency conversion from a currency where rates are quoted as number of units of foreign to 1 local (even when the rate is less than 1) to the EURO, e.g. IEP to EUR.
The system will default the base currency  for cross rates to be that currency which has a rate greater than 1, e.g.
local ccy = EUR      CCY1 = IEP, 0.8 to 1 EUR      CCY2 = GBP, 0.7 to 1 EUR
If no base currency is supplied then the system will default the base to be GBP and the cross rate to be 0.8 / 0.7 =  1.142857142857.
If IEP is set to have a base currency rank and GBP is not then the base currency will be set to IEP and the rate to be 0.875.
