				<ol>
					<li>Technical considerations
						<ul>
							<li>
								The new "table-expand-all" property is added to the widget type "TableTree". 
								In order to do that you have to edit the metamodel located in file
								page-designer.metamodel.
							</li>
							<li>
								Additionally an accessor is added to the helper interface ITable and 
								its default implementation to check if the expand/collapse all facility 
								is provided for the widget.
							</li>
							<li>
								And Finally the existing specific transformer for the WidgetType "TableTree"
								is adapted to take into account this new property in order to generate the 
								right code according to the FDS..
							</li>
						</ul>
