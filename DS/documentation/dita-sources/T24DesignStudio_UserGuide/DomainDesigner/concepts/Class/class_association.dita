  <conbody>
    <p>Associations are class properties that represent unidirectional
    relationships between two classes.</p>
    <p>Associations can be either <term>by value</term> or <term>by reference</term>, which
    respectively correspond to the object-oriented concepts of
    <term>composition</term> (intrinsic property) and <term>aggregation</term> (extrinsic
    property).</p>
    <p>Instances of class associated by value have the same life cycle as
    their containing instance; they do not exist outside of the scope of this
    container and cannot be referenced directly. A typical example is a
    <codeph>Portfolio</codeph> class that is associated by value  to a
    <codeph>Position</codeph> class that represents the held positions.</p>
    <p>Instances of class associated by reference have their own life cycle
    and live outside of the scope of the referencing class instance. A typical
    example is a <codeph>Portfolio</codeph> class that is associated by reference to the
    <codeph>Client</codeph> that owns the portfolio.</p>
    <p>The associated class can belong to another domain model file.</p>
