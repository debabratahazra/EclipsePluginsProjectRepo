		<p>
			In the Design Studio (DS) Workbench application, projects are top-level containers that store and organize a
			projectâ€™s resources. Design Studio provides designers for:
			<ul>
				<li>Domains (related to Domain Designer)</li>
				<li>Enquiries (related to the Enquiry Designer)</li>
				<li>Versions (related to Screen Designer).</li>
			</ul>
			Additional models take place for the new browser run with Edge Connect:
			<ul>
				<li>Menu (related to Menu Designer).</li>
				<li>Composite Screens (related to Eson Designer).</li>
				<li>Context Enquiry (related to Eson Designer).</li>
			</ul>
			Each designer will only contain its own model files (for example, the Domain Designer only contains model
			files of
			Domain Designer). Model files of each designer are organized using
			folders.
