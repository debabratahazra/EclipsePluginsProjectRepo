		<p>
			<b>What to do when I get technical error message, or nothing shows up in UI where it should?</b>
			<ul>
				<li> Open the Error Log view (Ctrl-3 "Error Log" or menu Window > Show View") - any recent red entries in
					there
					should be sent to Temenos support.
					Best to clear old Error, retry your action - send anything new that appears,
					by
					exporting them.
				</li>
				<li>Also check the *.log
					file next to your DesignStudio.EXE (in the installation directory) and
					send it
					along.
				</li>
				<li> Also always
					clarify which
					exact DS build version you're using (menu Help > About), and to exactly
					which
					release
					of T24 are you
					connecting.
					(You may "just" have a version mismatch.)
				</li>
			</ul>

		<p>The following error messages can be found in Design Studio.</p>
