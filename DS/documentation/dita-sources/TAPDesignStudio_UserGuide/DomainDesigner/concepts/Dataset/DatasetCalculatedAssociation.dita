  <conbody>
    <p>A  calculated association provides dataset extension by referencing another dataset.
    This intrinsic property of the dataset  doesn't exist in the base class. 
    So, the relationship the calculated association defines between two datasets doesn't exist between respective base classes. 
    The known usage of such extension is to expose a meta-model to outside world (OData).
    For instance, to create a reference between a format and a portfolio, which doesnâ€™t exist in between resp. classes.
    </p>
    <p>Completion rule cannot set value on this association. Calculated association's value is set at design time and is not made for being changed at runtime.</p>
    <p>Your calculated association, like calculated attribute is protected from being removed during the dataset synchronization. </p>
