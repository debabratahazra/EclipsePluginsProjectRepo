	/* The AC.AUTO.ACCOUNT table allows the definition of the parameters for the automatic creation of Sub-Accounts.

If the DEFAULT record is present then sub accounts will be automatically created for the following types of accounts without having to make changes at the account level or to set up records in AC.AUTO.ACCOUNT at category code level.
1 - Internal accounts with a suffix of 0001. The sub division code is the 4 characters after the category code, the SSSS position in the following structure CCYCATEGSSSSCCCC (CCCC indicates the sub division code of the company that owns the account in a multi book set up.
2 - Position accounts where the first 6 characters are a currency pair e.g. USDGBP for postion accounts the first 2 characters of the subdivision code indicate the dealer desk, so the maximum number of sub accounts is restricted to 99.
3 - Nostro customer accounts

The default method of incrementing the sub account key will be by adding 1 to the suffix unless the account is an intercompany account where the category code in the key will be incremented.

The maximum number of sub accounts created will be based on the highest agent value in TSA.PARAMETER.

If sub accounts are required for internal accounts with a suffix of other than 0001, for example where the suffix contains a DEPT.ACCT.OFFICER key then then the set up must be manual, by setting up the category record in this application and setting the MAX.SUB.ACCOUNT value on the individual accounts. This is because there may be limited range between master accounts in either the category code or suffix numbers

Sub accounts can be set up at category code level where there are special conditions required. In this case the sub account setup must take place at master account level by defining the MAX.SUB.ACCOUNTS.

Sub accounts can be set up for customer accounts, but this is not recomMended as balance checking is blocked because it is meaningless at sub account level.

Sub-Account processing is the automatic distribution of transactions over a group of accounts to avoid record locking.

Sub-Accounts may be created automatically by the Accounting sub-systems until the maximum number of sub-accounts that the Master account may hold or based on a dynamic value where the "DEFAULT" record is present. */

		/* Determines the type of sub account key that is created for internal accounts.
There are 2 options:-
SUFFIX indicates that the suffix part of the key will be incremented by 1 for each sub account created. The SUFFIX can be defined as the 4 characters in positions 9 to 12 of the account key. If an account already exists for the key to be created then this number will be skipped. If the incremented number exceeds 9999 then it will be reset to 2.
CATEG indicates that the CATEGORY part of the key will be incremented by 1 for each new sub account to be created. The CATEGORY can be defined as the 5 characters taking up positions 4 to 8. Again if an account already exists for the category to be created it number will be incremented.
BUFFER option will be for future use.

The reason for entering the CATEG option is that for some types of account the SUFFIX part of the key is significant, for example those accounts used in inter-company accounting, where the suffix in postions 9-12 indicates the company that is being posted to and therefore should not be changed. Sub accounts  for the category defined in ACCOUNT.CLASS "INTERCO" must be set to use the CATEG option. The sub accounts created will retain the original category code of the master account in the account record.
When intercompany accounting takes place sub account processing will take place if the master intercompany account being processed is set for sub account processing and it is locked by another user. */

	/* The Account Module caters for the creation, maintenance and control of all types of accounts handled by T24  It also provides:
-          Calculation and application of interest on customers' accounts.
-          Calculation of charges relating to the maintenance and            servicing of accounts.
-          Production of account statements and overdraft and referral            reports.
Accounts can be classified as two types :
Customer Accounts
These include any accounts related to a customer and are identified by account numbers of up to 14 digits including the check digit.  It is not possible to open a customer account until the relevant customer base record and group interest and charges conditions have been created.
In addition to the account number and the number of the customer base record to which the account relates, the record contains details such as: Currency, Category, Limit, Account Officer etc..  Customer details such as name, nationality, residence etc., are held in the customer base record and will be taken from that record as and when required.
Internal Accounts
These include any accounts not related to a customer, such as cash, unremitted profits and capital.  Since there is no customer base record related to Internal Accounts, details such as account title and short title need to be specified when the account is created.
Internal Accounts are identified by codes specifically structured to include information defining the account as follows:
-    Currency            -    Category            -    Subdivision within the main category classification.
In an extended multi company environment where accounts owned by different companies (branches) share the same account file the internal account will have the subdivision code of the owning company appended to the account number, so the account number will be 16 characters.

To allow accurate and detailed MIS analysis, profit and loss data is not held in internal accounts, but is kept at the lowest level by use of specific category codes which are used by all Applications to record profit and loss entries.
The main features of the Account Module can be summarised as follows:
Posting Restrictions
Various types of restrictions may be defined, such as 'Post No Debits', 'Wehereabouts Unknown'.  Entries meeting the specified conditions will prompt a message on the screen and will only be accepted with an override.
Referral
Special referral conditions can be defined depending on transaction details such as transaction code, amount and sign, or the balance of the account.
An end of day report is produced including details of transactions and balances for referral to the account officer.
Account Statements
Account statements show details of all entries over the account since the last statement.  Entries are listed in transaction date sequence and may show both transaction date and value date.
Statements may be produced every working day, every 1-9 weeks, twice a month on the 15th and the last day or every 1-6 months on any day of the month.
Two statement cycles may be specified for each account, e.g. weekly and monthly.  These cycles may be independent or combined:
-          Independent : Statements for each cycle show details of all            entries since the last statement in the same cycle, regardless            of the other cycle.
-          Combined : Statements are produced on the dates specified by            both cycles, but only contain details of entries since the            last statement from either cycle.
If there have been no entries since the last statement, the statement may be suppressed unless six months have elapsed.
Special interim statements, showing details of all entries since the last regular cycle 1 statement., may be produced any day without affecting the regular statement cycles.
Overdraft Report
This will show details of all accounts whose Limit is exceeded and any overdrawn accounts with no limit specified.
Group and Special Conditions
Conditions for the calculation and application of interest and charges are specified for groups of accounts and can be overridden with special conditions for individual accounts.
Account groups are determined automatically on the basis of customer and account details such as residence, sector, account category and currency. The criteria used and their order of priority are stored in user defined tables.
Interest Calculations
-          Interest may be calculated on a Daily, Average, or Highest/            Minimum balance basis using value dated balances.
-          The movements/balances on different accounts in the same            currency can be combined and interest calculated on the net            result.
-          Rates can be fixed or linked to basic rates plus or minus a            margin.
-          Different rates can be specified for different balance levels            and may be linked to the same or different basic rates.  The            rates may apply to the whole of the balance or to the part            between two balance levels.
-          Using group level conditions, it is possible to use the limits            on individual accounts as the first level for debit interest            so that one rate can be charged up to the limit on any account            and another rate when the limit has been exceeded.
-          Interest can be calculated on a 366/365, 366/360, 360/365 or            360/360 days basis.
-          Back valued entries generate automatic adjustments to            previously calculated interest.  For any accounts where            interest conditions or rates are changed with effect prior to            the last interest application, the system generates            adjustments on request.
Interest Application and Accrual
Dates
-          Interest may be applied daily, every working day, every 1-9            weeks, twice a month on the 15th and the last day or every            1-99 months on any day of the month.  The application dates            can be specified at group or account level.  Cycles may be            different for debit and credit interest.
-          Special interim applications may be requested without            affecting the regular cycle.
-          It is possible to accrue interest normally on a monthly basis            and specify certain types of accounts with daily accrual.
Special Cases
-          Interest may be paid or received from another account in the            same currency.
-          Credit interest may be calculated for the purpose of            off-setting debit interest only and not for application.  In            this case debit and credit interest application dates must be            the same.
-          Interest may be suspended for specific accounts i.e. not            posted to profit and loss.
-          It is possible to calculate interest for information only and            not accrue or apply it e.g. for Nostro accounts.
-          Detailed interest statements may be printed for specified            accounts whenever interest is applied.
Interest Related Charges
Tax on interest is calculated at application time.
Certain additional charges based on the debit interest application may be applied on the same date.  These include:
-          Debit Interest Addon - a percentage of the amount of debit            interest to be applied.
-          Government Margin - an additional interest rate applied to            each debit interest calculation.
-          Highest Debit - a percentage of the largest debit balance.
-          Interest Statement - a charge for providing a detailed            interest statement when debit interest is applied.
Account Maintenance Charges
Account Maintenance Charges may be levied monthly, quarterly or six monthly, always at the end of the appropriate month.  The same Application cycle is used for all accounts.  There are two main types of charges, as follows:
-          Balance Requirement
A flat charge can be levied if a certain average or minimum            balance is not maintained.  A range of charges for different            balances may be specified.
-          Transaction Charges
Charges can be made for the transactions passed over an            account.  These may be based on the number or the volume of            transactions and may be different for debit and credit or            for each transaction type.  Each transaction type may be            included or excluded from the calculations.  The various            types of transaction charges are as follows:
.    Number of credit            .    Number of debit            .    Turnover credit            .    Turnover debit            .    Transaction type
Charges may be combined into one account entry or applied            separately.  Free, minimum and maximum amounts can be            specified for each charge.
Separate charges can be defined for specific currencies and            local currency charges used as the default for all non-            specified currencies.
Offsetting and Waiving Charges
On specified accounts, charges may be calculated for information only and then waived.
Charges may also be waived if a certain average or minimum balance is maintained, if the amount of the charge is below a value worth charging or if the account has been into debit.
It is possible to specify that charges do not apply to foreign currency accounts.
Notional credit interest can be calculated and offset against the charges. */

		/* Identifies the Account.
It is assumed that the format of Customer Account numbers will be changed to suit each installation, provisionally it must conform to the modulus 11 check i.e. the Account number and a check digit must be entered.  The value of the check digit is calculated as shown below.
To calculate the Modulus 11 check digit:
1)         Starting from the low order digit (right), each digit of the            Account number has a weighting factor as shown below:             15 14 13 12 11 10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 Digit No.            X 4  3  2  7  6  5 4 3 2 7 6 5 4 3 2 Weighting     Results: +  +  +  +  +  + + + + + + + + + + = Y
2)         Each digit is multiplied by the appropriate weighting factor.
3)         All results are added and the total (Y) divided by eleven.
4)         Finally, the remainder from the division is subtracted from            11 to obtain the Check Digit.
Note:      If the calculated Check Digit is greater than 9, 3 is            subtracted from it to obtain the correct Check Digit.
Example:   Account number chosen = 1024562
1 0 2 4 5 6 2            X    2 7 6 5 4 3 2 (Weighting Factors)            Results: 2 + 0 + 12 + 20 + 20 + 18 + 4 = 76            76/11 = 6 Remainder 10
11 - 10 = 1 = Check Digit            Number to be entered = 10245621
Internal Account Numbers consist of a Currency Code, a Category Code and an identifying number, as follows:
(i)   3 type SSS (uppercase alpha) character Currency code or                 'L', which will generate the Local Currency code.
(ii)  5 numeric character, Category code in the range                  10000 to 19999.

If this account is defined as an ICA main account (ICA.MAIN.ACCT.IND = "YES") then this field is used to indicate the type of interest distribution used.
ICA interest is calculated when the main account is capitalised and is defined as follows.
ICA Group Difference = ICA Group Interest - ICA Normal Interest

ICA Group Interest is calculated by combining the balances of all accounts for the times that they were members of an ICA group. An ACCT.ACTIVITY record for the group with the key of MAIN.ACCOUNT*-YYYYMM (where YYYY is the year and MM is the month) is created. And the standard interest processing takes place based on the interest conditions of the main account. STMT.ACCT.XX records are written out for the group with the same key as for ACCT.ACTIVITY with a key of MAIN.ACCOUNT*SUB.ACCOUNT-YYYYMMDD.
Normal Interest is calculated as the total interest of all accounts in the group for the time that the accounts were group members during the calculation period.
If an account was only a partial member of the group during the calculation period then the partial normal interest is calculated. An ACCT.ACTIVITY record containing the balances of the account for the time it was a group member with a key of MAIN.ACCOUNT*SUB.ACCOUNT-YYYMM. Standard T24 interest processing takes place and STMT.ACCT.XX records are written for the sub account with the key of MAIN.ACCOUNT*SUB.ACCOUNT-YYYYMMDD.
The ICA Group Difference is distributed to the accounts in the group by one of two methods.

RATIO Method, the percentage of group interest defined in ICA.DISTRIB.RATIO for the sub account is allocated to the sub account.
INTEREST Method, The amount of interest earned by the sub account is used to determine the interest allocated to the sub account as follows

ICA Group Difference * ( Normal Interest / Interest earned by sub account)
In both cases the remainder of the ICA Group Difference is allocated to the main account.
NB. ICA interest only is distributed, charges and taxes are not applicable to this type of interest distribution.

Defines the main account in an Interest Compensation Account (ICA) Hierarchy to which this account is to be linked.
An ICA hierarchy consists of linked groups of accounts, each group consists of a main account together with an unlimited number of sub accounts.
A sub account in one group can be a main account in a lower level group.
There can be an unlimited number of group levels in an ICA hierarchy.
The main account in the top-level group is called the top account.
To define an ICA hierarchy the top account in the hierarchy must be defined in the ICA.HIERARCHY application. The definitions of the hierarchy must begin with the top-level account of the top-level group, and proceed to successively lower level groups. The top account in the hierarchy is linked to itself.
It is possible to back value the link to any date within the current capitalisation period of the main account, to do this use the ICA.START.DATE field, the default date is TODAY. If a link is back valued then any links made between the back value date and today will be removed.
To remove a link the ICA.ADD.REMOVE field is used, the default is to add a link. An account cannot be removed from an ICA hierarchy if it has accounts linked to it.
To remove a main account from a hierarchy the sub accounts linked to it must be either linked to other main accounts or removed from the hierarchy completely.
An account can be linked to any other account which is defined as an ICA main account assuming that the validation conditions are met.
It is also possible to link an account to a main account in another hierarchy.
If this account is also a main account then any accounts linked to this account will also be linked to the new main account through this account. In this way it is possible to move a complete sub structure of the hierarchy by changing the link of the highest level account of that sub structure.
Each main account has a corresponding ICA.GROUP.DETAIL record, which contains historical data of all linked relationships, both for accounts linked to and accounts linked from the main account. ICA.GROUP.DETAIL also contains details of ICA group interest distribution. ICA.GROUP.HISTORY contains interest distribution information for each time that the account was capitalised. ICA.GROUP.DETAIL will be updated on authorisation of the account record.
Validation Rules

The account to link to must meet the following criteria.

The currencies of the two accounts must be the same or be members of the same fixed currency group, e.g. EUR "IN" currencies.
The main account to which this account is to be linked must be defined as an ICA main account (ICA.MAIN.ACCT.IND = "YES")
If the account to link to is this account i.e. the top-level account of an ICA.HIERARCHY then the account must be defined in an ICA.HIERARCHY record
The main account to link to must not be set for automatic or pending closure

An Override will be generated if the capitalisation frequency of the main account to link to does not meet the following criteria.

The interest capitalisation frequencies of the two accounts must be the same or
If the capitalisation is monthly both accounts must have the same capitalisation day, the main account to link to can have a capitalisation frequency greater than this account. E.g. it is possible to link this account which, capitalises monthly on the 15

N.B using OVERRIDE.CLASS the overrides generated due to incompatible capitalisation frequencies can be treated as validation errors. */
