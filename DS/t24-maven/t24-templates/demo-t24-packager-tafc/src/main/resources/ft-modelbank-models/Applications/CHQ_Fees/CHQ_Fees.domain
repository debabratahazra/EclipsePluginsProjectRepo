	/* This table holds details of the charging structure to be applied to all cheque types for issues and periodic usage charges.
For each cheque type it is possible to define individual transaction codes for debit and credit and a profit/loss category for charges. Issue and periodic charges can then be set up on a band or level basis. Flat amounts can be defined for each or a zero amount entered to effectively waive charges by default if required.
In this way a flat amount may be defined for issue or issues may be charged band or level based on the current holding of the account in the cheque type concerned. This is best illustrated by the examples given later.
Similarly periodic usage charges may be based on a flat amount or on the number of cheques used during the charging period.
The issue charging period and the usage charging period may be different since they are based on seperate frequency fields.

Issue Example (a):
Cheques are issued in books of 25. Customers are to be charged a flat amount of 5 GBP per cheque book issue up to a maximum of 8 cheque books per year. After this, ie beyond 200 cheques per year, each cheque issued will carry an additional charge of 10 pence making the total charge for issue of a ninth cheque book 5 + 2.5 = 7.50 GBP. Fields would be entered as follows:
4         FLAT.ISSUE.CHG.... 5.00 5         ISSUE.BAND.LEVEL.. BAND 6.1       ISSUE.UPTO...... 200 7.1       ISSUE.CHG.AMT... 0.00 6.2       ISSUE.UPTO...... 7.2       ISSUE.CHG.AMT... 0.10 8         ISSUE.START.DATE.. 1501 9         ISSUE.CHG.FQU..... M1215
Here the flat issue charge is set to 5.00 so this amount will be charged for each issue regardless of the holding details. The charging period cycles every 12 months on the 15th (M1215) and begins again on the 15th of January each year (purposely not the first so as to minimise end of year charge processing). Thus up to 200 cheques may be issued between 15th Jan 1991 and 14th Jan 1992 and each issue will raise charges of 5.00 GBP. The current holding is taken from the ISSUED.THIS.PD field of the appropriate record on the CHEQUE.REGISTER file. This field is updated automatically at authorisation of each issue. The ninth issue will report this as 200 so charges will move into the next band and 25 will be charged at 0.10 plus the flat amount of 5.00 giving 7.50 total for the issue.
Issue Example (b):
Eurocheques are issued in blocks of 10. They are charged at 0.50 GBP per cheque for holdings of upto 50 but beyond this become less expensive at 0.40 GBP per cheque. There are no flat charges for issue.  The charging period is quarterly. Fields are entered as follows:
4         FLAT.ISSUE.CHG.... 0.00 5         ISSUE.BAND.LEVEL.. BAND 6.1       ISSUE.UPTO...... 50 7.1       ISSUE.CHG.AMT... 0.50 6.2       ISSUE.UPTO...... 7.2       ISSUE.CHG.AMT... 0.40 8         ISSUE.START.DATE.. 1501 9         ISSUE.CHG.FQU..... M0315
Here the flat charge is zero. Charging is banded so that each cheque issued is charged at 0.50 GBP until there have been 50 issued to the account during the charging period. Issues after this time will charge 0.40 GBP per cheque. The charging period will reset every three months on the 15th of the month.
Periodic charges can be raised for the usage of cheques during a given period. If it is desired charges can therefore be defined for both issue and usage. This may be the case for Eurocheques but would be less usual for other common types of cheques. The calculation of charges and their definition is the same as those for issue except that the number involved is taken as the number used during the charging period. Note that no charges will be applied unless there has been a cheque used during the charging period. This includes the flat amount per period if defined. */

		/* Specifies wether charges will be calculated on a banded or on a level basis.
Charges may be calculated on either a band or level basis.  The principle used is common to many other T24 modules. Band charging raises a different charge for each number of cheques falling into rising bands, level charging locates the level the number falls within and charges all cheques at that level. This is best illustrated with several examples as follows:
In the following configuration a flat charge has not been defined (if it were, it would be added to the result of the band/level charges). Also the example uses ascending charges for larger numbers of cheques, descending bands and levels are equally possible and would in fact be more commonly used in practice.
5 ISSUE.BAND.LEVEL.. BAND 6.1 ISSUE.UPTO...... 75 7.1 ISSUE.CHG.AMT... 0.10 6.2 ISSUE.UPTO...... 150 7.2 ISSUE.CHG.AMT... 0.15 6.3 ISSUE.UPTO...... 7.3 ISSUE.CHG.AMT... 0.20
The issue of cheques would be charged at 0.10 GBP per cheque until the number issued during the charging period exceeds 75 whereupon the charge per cheque would become 0.15 GBP and so on up the band structure. Note the last band is always empty to imply a ceiling above which all cheques are charged at this maximum band rate. So for the issue of the first 25 cheques the charge would be:
25 x 0.10 GBP = 2.50 GBP
If a further four cheque books of 25 cheques were subsequently issued they would be charged at:
50 x 0.10 GBP =  5.00 GBP 50 x 0.15 GBP =  7.50 GBP                 12.50 GBP
The next four book issue would be charged:
25 x 0.15 GBP =  3.75 GBP 75 x 0.20 GBP = 15.00 GBP                 18.75 GBP
A further 6 books would be simply:
150 x 0.20 GBP = 30.00 GBP
If the same configuration were used on a LEVEL charging basis the first 25 cheques would be charged at 0.10 GBP per cheque. The next issue of 100 would be charged at the next higher level of 0.15 per cheque since 100 exceeds the first level of 75. The next 100 would also be charged at 0.15 per cheque as would the last. Only an issue of more than six books would invoke the highest defined band charge of 0.20 GBP per cheque.
