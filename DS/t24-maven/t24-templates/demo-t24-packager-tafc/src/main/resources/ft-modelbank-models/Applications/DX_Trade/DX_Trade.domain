- USD = US Dollars - GBP = Pounds Sterling - DEM = Deutsche Marks - FRF = French Francs

Numeric format - In most Treasury operations, certain currencies are traded more often that others. To continually enter a three alpha character code would be unnecessarily time consuming. Currencies may therefore be given a numeric ranking between 1 and 999 on the Currency table. If USD is the most frequently traded currency it should have a numeric code of 1.

		/* This field is used when the secondary counterparty (This is normally the broker.)of the deal instructs us to pay funds to another party who does not have an account with us.
When a contract matures, funds must be moved to actually settle the contract. This involves paying the counterparty or his nominated beneficiary for the currency sold and receiving funds for the currency purchased. The counterparty will advise us of where the money which we have sold is to be paid and we will advise them where we require the currency purchased to be remitted. The delivery of funds will normally be as one payment but may be in several instalments.
Entry in this field will be accepted where the beneficiary is known to the bank (i.e. there is a customer record for the beneficiary). If the beneficiary is not known to us, the beneficiary details may be entered in the Beneficiary address field.
Note that, where the beneficiary requests the funds into an account he has with us, this should be specified in the Our Account Pay field.
It is important to note that when the Beneficiary is specified, the Counterparty Correspondent field will be used to indicate the bank of the beneficiary.
The counterparty may ask us to pay the amount sold in a number of ways:
To an account with us
We may pay the funds directly into an account provided it is in the same currency as that being sold. To make payment directly to a counterparty's internal account the relevant account number should be entered in the Our Account Pay field and no other input will be necessary in this field.
To an account at another bank overseas
To pay money to another bank overseas we would have to advise our agent, in the country concerned, to pay to the counterparty's bank. In this case, the Nostro account number of our agent should be entered in the Our Account Pay field. If the counterparty's bank is known to us (i.e. there is a customer record), then the bank's number should be entered in CPARTY.CORR.NO if these details have not yet been defined on the Agency file. If the bank is not known to us, (i.e. there is no customer record) the bank's name and address should be entered in the multi-valued field CPARTY.CORR.ADD. When known, the counterparty's account number at his bank should be entered in the field CPARTY.BANK.ACC.
To an account at another bank locally
Where payment is to be effected locally, settlement can be through a number of different methods. The most common are Banker's Payments, CHIPS, or CHAPS. In all cases, the number of our internal clearing account, or our clearing agent should be entered in OUR.ACCOUNT.PAY. Details of the counterparty's bank account should be completed as detailed above.
To a beneficiary of the counterparty
The counterparty may nominate a third party beneficiary of the funds. If the beneficiary is to be paid by crediting an account with us, the account number should be entered in OUR.ACCOUNT.PAY. If the beneficiary does not have an account with us, the internal clearing number or Nostro account of our agent should be entered in OUR.ACCOUNT.PAY.
Where we are paying to another bank but the beneficiary is known to us (i.e. there is a customer record), the customer number of the beneficiary will be entered in the field BENEFICIARY.NO. Where no relationship exists, the payment details will be entered in the multi-valued field BENFCY.ADD.
Payment via an intermediary bank
Occasionally the counterparty may ask for payment to be made through an intermediary bank. This occurs where the counterparty or beneficiary's correspondent is not in the country of the currency involved. As an example, let us say that the BANK 'ABC' in Hong Kong uses BANK 'XYZ' in Hong Kong as their dollar agent. When a dollar payment is to be made we would pay American Bank in New York (the Intermediary) for Bank XYZ in HK (the Cparty correspondent), account Bank ABC (the Cparty or Beneficiary). The Intermediary can be entered as a number in the INTERMED.BK.NO field if a customer relationship exists (i.e. there is a customer number) or as narrative in the INTERMED.ADD field.

We may pay the funds directly into an account provided it is in the same currency as that being sold. To make payment directly to a counterparty's internal account the relevant account number should be entered in the OUR.ACCOUNT.PAY field and no other input will be necessary in this field.
To an account at another bank overseas
To pay money to another bank overseas we would have to advise our agent, in the country concerned, to pay to the counterparty's bank. In this case, the Nostro account number of our agent should be entered in the OUR.ACCOUNT.PAY field. If the counterparty's bank is known to us (i.e. there is a customer record), then the bank's number should be entered in CPARTY.CORR.NO if these have not yet been defined on the Agency file. If the bank is not known to us, (i.e. there is no customer record) the bank's name and address should be entered in the multi-valued field CPY.CORR.ADD. When known, the counterparty's account number at his bank should be entered in the field CPARTY.BANK.ACC.
To an account at another bank locally
Where payment is to be effected locally, settlement can be through a number of different methods. The most common are Banker's Payments, CHIPS, or CHAPS. In all cases, the number of our internal clearing account, or our clearing agent should be entered in OUR.ACCOUNT.PAY. Details of the counterparty's bank account should be completed as detailed above.
To a beneficiary of the counterparty
The counterparty may nominate a third party beneficiary of the funds. If the beneficiary is to be paid by crediting an account with us, the account number should be entered in OUR.ACCOUNT.PAY. If the beneficiary does not have an account with us, the internal clearing number or Nostro account of our agent should be entered in OUR.ACCOUNT.PAY.
Where we are paying to another bank but the beneficiary is known to us (i.e. there is a customer record), the customer number of the beneficiary will be entered in the field BENEFICIARY.NO. Where no relationship exists, the payment details will be entered in the multi-valued field BENFCY.ADD.
Payment via an intermediary bank
Occasionally the counterparty may ask for payment to be made through an intermediary bank. This occurs where the counterparty or beneficiary's correspondent is not in the country of the currency involved. As an example, let us say that the Bank ABC in Hong Kong uses Bank 'XYZ' in Hong Kong as their dollar agent. When a dollar payment is to be made we would pay American Bank in New York (the Intermediary) for Bank 'XYZ' in (the counterparty correspondent), account Bank 'ABC' (the counterparty or Beneficiary). The Intermediary can be entered as a number in the INTERMED.BK.NO field if a customer relationship exists (i.e. there is a customer number) or as narrative in the INTERMED.ADD field.

Input is not acceptable for Negotiated or other internal         deals.
Input is not allowed unless the counterparty is known (i.e.         deal sub-type is not 'BR'). */

		/* When a contract matures, funds must be moved to actually settle the contract. This involves paying the Primary Counterparty (This would normally be a Customer.)or his nominated beneficiary for the currency sold and receiving funds for the currency purchased. The counterparty will advise us of where the money which we have sold is to be paid and we will advise them where we require the currency purchased to be remitted. The delivery of funds will normally be as one payment but may be in several instalments.
Entry in this field will be accepted where the beneficiary is known to the bank (i.e. there is a customer record for the beneficiary). If the beneficiary is not known to us, the beneficiary details may be entered in the Beneficiary address field.
Note that, where the beneficiary requests the funds into an account he has with us, this should be specified in the Our Account Pay field.
It is important to note that when the Beneficiary is specified, the Primary Counterparty Correspondent field will be used to indicate the bank of the beneficiary.
The primary counterparty may ask us to pay the amount sold in a number of ways:
To an account with us
We may pay the funds directly into an account provided it is in the same currency as that being sold. To make payment directly to a counterparty's internal account the relevant account number should be entered in the Our Account Pay field and no other input will be necessary in this field.
To an account at another bank overseas
To pay money to another bank overseas we would have to advise our agent, in the country concerned, to pay to the counterparty's bank. In this case, the Nostro account number of our agent should be entered in the Our Account Pay field. If the counterparty's bank is known to us (i.e. there is a customer record), then the bank's number should be entered in CPARTY.CORR.NO if these details have not yet been defined on the Agency file. If the bank is not known to us, (i.e. there is no customer record) the bank's name and address should be entered in the multi-valued field CPARTY.CORR.ADD. When known, the counterparty's account number at his bank should be entered in the field CPARTY.BANK.ACC.
To an account at another bank locally
Where payment is to be effected locally, settlement can be through a number of different methods. The most common are Banker's Payments, CHIPS, or CHAPS. In all cases, the number of our internal clearing account, or our clearing agent should be entered in OUR.ACCOUNT.PAY. Details of the counterparty's bank account should be completed as detailed above.
To a beneficiary of the counterparty
The counterparty may nominate a third party beneficiary of the funds. If the beneficiary is to be paid by crediting an account with us, the account number should be entered in OUR.ACCOUNT.PAY. If the beneficiary does not have an account with us, the internal clearing number or Nostro account of our agent should be entered in OUR.ACCOUNT.PAY.
Where we are paying to another bank but the beneficiary is known to us (i.e. there is a customer record), the customer number of the beneficiary will be entered in the field BENEFICIARY.NO. Where no relationship exists, the payment details will be entered in the multi-valued field BENFCY.ADD.
Payment via an intermediary bank
Occasionally the counterparty may ask for payment to be made through an intermediary bank. This occurs where the counterparty or beneficiary's correspondent is not in the country of the currency involved. As an example, let us say that the BANK 'ABC' in Hong Kong uses BANK 'XYZ' in Hong Kong as their dollar agent. When a dollar payment is to be made we would pay American Bank in New York (the Intermediary) for Bank XYZ in HK (the Cparty correspondent), account Bank ABC (the Cparty or Beneficiary).

Details of the counterparty's bank account should be completed as detailed above.
To a beneficiary of the counterparty
The counterparty may nominate a third party beneficiary of the funds. If the beneficiary is to be paid by crediting an account with us, the account number should be entered in OUR.ACCOUNT.PAY. If the beneficiary does not have an account with us, the internal clearing number or Nostro account of our agent should be entered in OUR.ACCOUNT.PAY.
Where we are paying to another bank but the beneficiary is known to us (i.e. there is a customer record), the customer number of the beneficiary will be entered in the field BENEFICIARY.NO. Where no relationship exists, the payment details will be entered in the multi-valued field BENFCY.ADD.
Payment via an intermediary bank
Occasionally the counterparty may ask for payment to be made through an intermediary bank. This occurs where the counterparty or beneficiary's correspondent is not in the country of the currency involved. As an example, let us say that the Bank 'ABC' in Hong Kong uses Bank 'XYZ' in Hong Kong as their dollar agent. When a dollar payment is to be made we would pay American Bank in New York (the Intermediary) for Bank 'XYZ' HK (the counterparty correspondent), account Bank 'ABC' (the counterparty or Beneficiary). The Intermediary can be entered as a number in the INTERMED.BK.NO field if a customer relationship exists (i.e. there is a customer number) or as narrative in the INTERMED.ADD field.

When a contract matures, funds must be moved to actually settle the contract.

The primary counterparty will advise us of where the money which we have sold is to be paid and we will advise them where we require the currency purchased to be remitted. The delivery of funds will normally be as one payment but may be in several instalments.
If the beneficiary is known to us (i.e. there is a customer record), the beneficiary details should be entered in the BENEFICIARY.NO field.

It is important to note that when the Beneficiary is specified, the Primary Counterparty Correspondent field will be used to indicate the bank of the beneficiary.
The counterparty may ask us to pay the amount sold in a number of ways:
To an account with us
We may pay the funds directly into an account provided it is in the same currency as that being sold. To make payment directly to a counterparty's internal account the relevant account number should be entered in the OUR.ACCOUNT.PAY field and no other input will be necessary in this field.

When a contract matures, funds must be moved to actually settle the contract. This involves paying the counterparty or his nominated beneficiary for the currency sold and receiving funds for the currency purchased. The counterparty will advise us of where the money which we have sold is to be paid and we will advise them where we require the currency purchased to be remitted. The delivery of funds will normally be as one payment but may be in several instalments.
If the beneficiary is known to us (i.e. there is a customer record), the beneficiary details should be entered in the BENEFICIARY.NO field. If unknown to us, details should be entered in this multi-value field. Note that, where the beneficiary requests the funds into an account he has with us, this should be specified in the OUR.ACCOUNT.PAY field.
It is important to note that when the Beneficiary is specified, the Counterparty Correspondent field will be used to indicate the bank of the beneficiary.
The counterparty may ask us to pay the amount sold in a number of ways:
To an account with us
We may pay the funds directly into an account provided it is in the same currency as that being sold. To make payment directly to a counterparty's internal account the relevant account number should be entered in the OUR.ACCOUNT.PAY field and no other input will be necessary in this field.
To an account at another bank overseas
To pay money to another bank overseas we would have to advise our agent, in the country concerned, to pay to the counterparty's bank. In this case, the Nostro account number of our agent should be entered in the OUR.ACCOUNT.PAY field. If the counterparty's bank is known to us (i.e. there is a customer record), then the bank's number should be entered in CPARTY.CORR.NO if these details have not yet been defined on the Agency file. If the bank is not known to us, (i.e. there is no customer record) the bank's name and address should be entered in the multi-valued field CPARTY.CORR.ADD. When known, the counterparty's account number at his bank should be entered in the field CPARTY.BANK.ACC.
To an account at another bank locally
Where payment is to be effected locally, settlement can be through a number of different methods. The most common are Banker's Payments, CHIPS, or CHAPS. In all cases, the number of our internal clearing account, or our clearing agent should be entered in OUR.ACCOUNT.PAY. Details of the counterparty's bank account should be completed as detailed above.
To a beneficiary of the counterparty
The counterparty may nominate a third party beneficiary of the funds. If the beneficiary is to be paid by crediting an account with us, the account number should be entered in OUR.ACCOUNT.PAY. If the beneficiary does not have an account with us, the internal clearing number or Nostro account of our agent should be entered in OUR.ACCOUNT.PAY.
Where we are paying to another bank but the beneficiary is known to us (i.e. there is a customer record), the customer number of the beneficiary will be entered in the field BENEFICIARY.NO. Where no relationship exists, the payment details will be entered in the multi-valued field BENFCY.ADD.
Payment via an intermediary bank
Occasionally the counterparty may ask for payment to be made through an intermediary bank. This occurs where the counterparty or beneficiary's correspondent is not in the country of the currency involved. As an example, let us say that the Bank 'ABC' in Hong Kong uses Bank 'XYZ' in Hong Kong as their dollar agent. When a dollar payment is to be made we would pay American Bank in New York (the Intermediary) for Bank 'XYZ in HK (the Cparty correspondent), account Bank 'ABC' (the Cparty or Beneficiary). The Intermediary can be entered as a number in the INTERMED.BK.NO field if a customer relationship exists (i.e. there is a customer number) or as narrative in the Intermed Add field.

The CPARTY may nominate a third party beneficiary of the funds. If the beneficiary is to be paid by crediting an account with us, the account number should be entered in OUR.ACCOUNT.PAY. If the beneficiary does not have an account with us, the internal clearing number or Nostro account of our agent should be entered in OUR.ACCOUNT.PAY.
Where we are paying to another bank but the beneficiary is known to us (i.e. there is a customer record), the customer number of the beneficiary will be entered in the field BENEFICIARY.NO. Where no relationship exists, the payment details will be entered in the multi-valued field BENFCY.ADD.
Payment via an intermediary bank
Occasionally the CPARTY may ask for payment to be made through an intermediary bank. This occurs where the CPARTY or beneficiary's correspondent is not in the country of the currency involved. As an example, let us say that the Bank 'ABC' in Hong Kong uses Bank 'XYZ' in Hong Kong as their dollar agent. When a dollar payment is to be made we would pay American Bank in New York (the Intermediary) for Bank 'XYZ' in HK (the CPARTY correspondent), account Bank 'ABC' (the CPARTY or Beneficiary). The Intermediary can be entered as a number in the INTERMED.BK.NO field if a customer relationship exists (i.e. there is a customer number) or as narrative in the INTERMED.ADD field.
