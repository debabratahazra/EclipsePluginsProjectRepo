For every person who is allowed to use T24., a User record must be created.  This contains identification details and specifies precisely what information and facilities are available, the dates and times at which the System may be accessed and other information required for Security Management.  The information held is detailed below:
1.        Identification
Identifying details for each User include a unique Sign           On Name, Secret Password, Name, Classification           ('External' customer or 'Internal' employee of the           bank), Company or branch and Department.
In addition, User preferences such as the Language in           which messages etc. should be displayed, can be           specified.
2.        Permitted Times of Use
Details specifying when each User can access the           System include Start Date, End Date, Start Time, End           Time, the maximum time during which the User may be           inactive without being Signed Off automatically, the           number of unsuccessful attempts to Sign On allowed           before the Password is disabled, the frequency with           which the Password must be changed and dates           between which the Password should be deactivated.
3.        Permitted Activity
For 'External' Users, the customer(s) whose records           may be accessed must be specified and account           numbers may be specified.           For all Users the information and facilities which may           be accessed are specified at 4 levels: COMPANY           APPLICATION (and VERSION), FUNCTION, FIELD so           that it is possible to specify precisely which records,           belonging to which company, may be accessed and what           may be done with them.
Up to 999 combinations of Company, Application,           Function and Field are allowed.
4.        Activity Logging
Security Violations are always recorded in the           PROTOCOL file, in addition it is possible to specify in           the User record that some or all permitted activities by           selected Users should be recorded.
5.        Local Elements
Additional data elements can be defined to suit local           requirements.  This is done by using LOCAL.TABLE           and LOCAL.REF.TABLE as explained in the Utilities           Help Text. */

Note: It is not possible to prevent a User from entering on override during input, but Authorization can be restricted, as above, to ensure that any overrides are checked by a more senior person. " is the lowest value a field can have, so specifying LT (Less Than) " ensures that no override may be present.
Example 4:
Restricting FOREX transactions to a counterparties that belong to a specific account officer.

20.1(FUNCTION) I
21.1(FIELD.NO) CUSTOMER>ACCOUNT.OFFICER
22.1(DATA COMPARISON) EQ
23.1(DATA.FROM) 100
Note: As you can see the field specified does not have to belong to the application. If the system can link the APPLICATION to the field then the SMS restriction will be applied. In this example the COUNTERPARTY field on the FOREX file provides the link to the CUSTOMER file. Hence when the transaction is input T24 reads the CUSTOMER file using the COUNTERPARTY as the key and checks that the ACCOUNT.OFFICER is 100. You do not have to define that the COUNTERPARTY as the key to CUSTOMER file this is done automatically based on the RELATED.FILE stored in the STANDARD.SELECTION record for FOREX.
Note: If you wish to test a value in a related file a consderable process load can be incurred when the user lists the file. This can be relieved by defining the related field as a J-descriptor user field on the STANDARD.SELECTION record and using that. Thus in the example above define CUST.OFFICER as type J, CUSTOMER>ACCOUNT.OFFICER and then specify the FIELD.NO as FOREX>CUST.OFFICER.

When defining the enquires a user can run, you can also 'turn off' all SMS checks for a particular enquiry. This is useful when the enquiry presents non sensitive information from sensitive files. I.e you may wish to show customer and account static information (address, account titles etc ) but not show the balances. As the enquiry itself controls the presentation there may be no need for any additional security. To suppress SMS you must append *NOSMS to the name of the enquiry. E.G.
Field 18.1 (APPLICATION) ENQUIRY.SELECT
Field 20.1(FUNCTION) I
Field 21.1(FIELD.NO) 0

T Programs which handle automatically updated CONCAT files, e.g. CUSTOMER.ACCOUNT (only L, S and P functions can be used with this type of program).

Example 2:
To create a group which allows a User access to Account records only if they have Currency equal GBP and Category not in the range 01-001 to 01-099.
Field 2.1  (APPLICATION)      ACCOUNT       4.1  (FUNCTION)         ALL       5.1  (FIELD.NO)         8       (Currency)       6.1  (DATA.COMPARISON)  EQ      (equal)       7.1  (DATA.FROM)        GBP       2.2  (APPLICATION)      ACCOUNT       4.2  (FUNCTION)         ALL       5.2  (FIELD.NO)         2       (Category)       6.2  (DATA.COMPARISON)  NE      (not equal)       7.2  (DATA.FROM)        01-001       8.2  (DATA.TO)          01-099
Example 3:
To allow a User to Authorise Data Capture records, but only if they do not contain an override.
Field 2.1  (APPLICATION)      DATA.CAPTURE       4.1  (FUNCTION)         A       5.1  (FIELD.NO)         24 (Override)       6.1  (DATA COMPARISON)  LT (Less Than)       7.1  (DATA.FROM)        "  (lowest possible value)
Note:      It is not possible to prevent a User from entering on            override during input, but Authorisation can be            restricted, as above, to ensure that any overrides are            checked by a more senior person.  " is the lowest value            a field can have, so specifying LT (Less Than) " ensures            that no override may be present.

Multivalue field associated with Fields 2.1 to 6.1 and 8.1.
(Mandatory input if FIELD NO is entered, otherwise input is not allowed.)
This field specifies either a single value or the lower limit of a range with which the contents of the field indicated in FIELD NO (Field 5.1) are compared.
Note:      The values input in this field and the next one must be in            agreement with the Format rules of the element specified            in Field 5.1.  If, for example, the input in Field 5.1            corresponds to a Customer Mnemonic, a minimum input of            3 characters will be required in this field.
When defining the enquires a user can run, you can also 'turn off' all SMS checks for a particular enquiry. This is useful when the enquiry presents non sensitive information from sensitive files. I.e you may wish to show customer and account static information (address, account titles etc ) but not show the balances. As the enquiry itself controls the presentation there may be no need for any additional security. To suppress SMS you must append *NOSMS to the name of the enquiry. E.G. Field 2.1  (APPLICATION)      ENQUIRY.SELECT Field 4.1  (FUNCTION)         I Field 5.1  (FIELD.NO)         0 Field 6.1  (DATA.COMPARISON)  EQ Field 7.1  (DATA.FROM)        CUSTOMER.STATIC*NOSMS
This mechanism works only with ENQUIRY.SELECT and must be entered in the format detailed above.
