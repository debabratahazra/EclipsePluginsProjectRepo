	/* All T24 screens have been designed within a set structure and most Data Sections of the screen are very similar (one field per line with enrichment of 35 characters per field).
The VERSION file has been developed to enable Users to redesign the Data Section (line 5 to line 20) of any T24. screen to suit their own preferences/requirements. An infinite number of versions of each screen can be created, and are then called up by appending ',X' (where X = Version identity) to the Application name.
Basically, the VERSION file is organised in three sections:
1.         The first section defines general information such as :
. Print or Screen identification.            . Number of records per page.            . Number of fields per line.            . Languages.            . Headers.
2.         The second section enables the layout of fields to be            arranged on the screen, field descriptions to be            defined in any language and length of enrichments to            be specified.
3.         The third section enables the User to define operating            conditions specific to the Version being created by            means of parameters such as :
. Number of authorisation(s)            . Definition of 'No-input' fields            . Definition of 'No-change' fields            . Fields to be rekeyed for authorisation            . Automatic default values */

		/* Enables the specific Version of an application to be uniquely identified.

The name, or an Abbreviation, for the Application of which a Version is required must be entered followed by a comma. In cases where more than one Version exists, each Version must be specified by appending further unique identity.

Symbols and Special Characters for eg: ( !@#$% ) can used to form the id for version, but the same cannot be used in the VERSION field in USER and USER.SMS.GROUP applications. Hence versions with symbols and special characters will not be accepted in USER and USER.SMS.GROUP applications.

Example:
The following is a list of possible ID's for the creation of various Versions for the CUSTOMER file:
. Customer,1 . Customer,99 . Customer,abc
. Customer,3a . Customer,Smith etc... . Cust,Special (where CUST is an abbreviation of CUSTOMER)

The Version identity must not     be greater than 22 characters.

1.         In which column the Text previously defined will start            and,
2.         the total length generated by the field (including            Text, input itself and the enrichment defined in the            previous fields and necessary spaces between fields on            the same line).
Example:
If this field displays the information : 1|18
where:
1    indicates that the field starts in column 1 and
18   indicates that the field uses 18 columns on the                 screen or report.
In the above example (1|18), the System is telling the User that this field will start in column 1 and uses in total 18 columns.  If he wants to define a second field on the same line, the second field can only be defined starting from at least column 19 i.e. 1 + 18.  If the User enters a column number smaller than 19, the System would then automatically place this field on the next line.
Validation Rules
A|B where A    is a number indicating in which column the field starts and B    is a number indicating the total number of columns that this field will occupy on the screen. (Internal field) */

		/* Enables the User to define the new automatic default value. Must be used in conjunction with AUTOMATIC OLD CONTENT (Field 44) and AUTOMATIC FIELD NUMBER (Field 43).
A routine (preceded by "@") may be specified instead of actual values. The routine will only be executed if the EXC.INC.RTN field is set to Y.
Input in this field must be in accordance with the field definition of the selected Application. Quotes should only be used where the new data actually requires quotes e.g if a new value is required to be YES it should not be input as "YES".
It is important to clearly understand the relation between this field and AUTOMATIC OLD CONTENT. The following examples will clarify their use.
1. When the User wants to create an automatic default at the creation of new record ID's, he should then make the following input in these three fields :
AUTOMATIC FIELD NUMBER - Indicates the field number for which you want to create an automatic default. AUTOMATIC OLD CONTENT - Must remain blank. AUTOMATIC NEW CONTENT - Enter the value which you want to default automatically.
2. When you want to replace automatically an old content by a new content, you should then make the following input in these three fields :
AUTOMATIC FIELD NUMBER - Indicate the field number for which you want to change automatically the old content.
AUTOMATIC OLD CONTENT - Enter the old content AUTOMATIC NEW CONTENT - Enter the new content which you want to replace automatically.
3. When you want to run a subroutine which will default a value in a particular field, you should make the following input in these three fields :
AUTOMATIC FIELD NUMBER - Indicates the field number for which you want to create a automatic default AUTOMATIC OLD CONTENT - Must remain blank AUTOMATIC NEW CONTENT - Enter the subroutine name
which needs to be executed for the the field in AUTOMATIC.FIELD.NUMBER.
Note: If the field AUTOMATIC OLD CONTENT is specified, only records containing the specified value will be changed when using this Version.
If the field AUTOMATIC OLD CONTENT is not specified, the content specified in the field AUTOMATIC NEW CONTENT (Field 44) will be generated when creating a new record with this Version.
The value of the AUT.NEW.CONTENT field can be set using a system (e.g. TODAY, COMPANY, etc.) or user-defined (e.g. CURRENT.CUSTOMER, CURRENT.ACCOUNT, etc.) variable.  In order to use the value of a variable an "!" character must be used preceding the variable name.  For example, a field can be defaulted to today's date by using "!TODAY" or the value of a user defined variable containing a customer number by using "!CURRENT.CUSTOMER".
Validation Rules

Deal Slips can be printed to a connected local printer or directed to a Network device. Refer to the REPORT CONTROL section of the Systems Administration User Guide for details of setting up printers.
Deal slips can be linked to a function such as Input, Reversal or Authorisation and specific Deal Slips can be made to relate to those functions.
Either an ENQUIRY record or a DEAL.SLIP.FORMAT record can be entered. If a valid DEAL.SLIP.FORMAT then the system will provide an enrichment from the record so the user will know thay have the correct record.
Alternatively, an ENQUIRY record can be used to provide a Deal Slip, in this case the enrrichment will inform the user that an ENQUIRY record has been selected.
The user can drilldown to the related table DEAL.SLIP.FORMAT to view or select the record to use.
The combination of the associated fields is used to define when the Deal Slip can be produced.
To trigger them automatically you need to define:
Field#Content Required##
D.SLIP.FORMAT#TELLER.SLIP.INPUT##
D.SLIP.FUNCTION#I##
D.SLIP.TRIGGER#OL##

This will only print the Deal Slip TELLER.SLIP.INPUT when the deal is validated at I(nput) time.
To trigger them via a "hot key" or the Desktop Deal Slip icon you need
Field#Content Required##
D.SLIP.FORMAT#TELLER.SLIP.INPUT##
D.SLIP.FUNCTION#I##
D.SLIP.TRIGGER#RQ##
This will only print the Deal Slip TELLER.SLIP.INPUT at I(nput) time when the 'hot key' is used.
Note:
ENQUIRY linked Deal Slips are valid for Desktop (GUI) use only. Since the ENQUIRY will be based on either the live or unauthorised file then only data that is available on those files can be accessed, whereas DEAL.SLIP.FORMAT can utilise the new data being entered on a deal. ENQUIRY deal slips therefore need to be based on the live or unauthorised record depending on when the deal slip is being produced. For example a new deal would probably be based on the unauthorised record whereas a reversal would be based on the live record.

AUT.FLD.NO - Indicates the field number for which you want to create an automatic default. AUT.OLD.CONT - Must remain blank. AUT.NEW.CONT - Enter the value which you want to default automatically.


2. When you want to replace automatically an old content by a new content, you should then make the following input in these three fields :


AUT.FLD. NO - Indicate the field number for which you want to change automatically the old content.


AUT.OLD .CONT - Enter the old content AUT.NEW.CONT - Enter the new content which you want to replace automatically.


3. When you want to run a subroutine which will default a value in a particular field, you should make the following input in these three fields :


AUT.FLD.NO - Indicates the field number for which you want to create a automatic default AUT.OLD.CONT - Must remain blank. AUT.NEW.CONT - Enter the subroutine name which needs to be executed for the the field in AUT.FLD.NO.


Note: If the field AUT.OLD.CONT is specified, only records containing the specified value will be changed when using this Version.


If the field AUT.OLD.CONT is not specified, the content specified in the field AUT.NEW.CONT will be generated when creating a new record with this Version.

D.SLIP.TRIGGER of the VERSION record, it is defaulted to RQ. The value(s) defined here are used to produce Deal Slips according to the function and whether the user wants to have them produced automatically or when a 'hot key' is used. Deal Slips can be printed to a connected local printer or directed to a Network device. Refer to the REPORT CONTROL section of the Systems Administration User Guide for details of setting up printers.
Deal slips can be linked to a function such as Input, Reversal or Authorisation and specific Deal Slips can be made to relate to those functions. Either an ENQUIRY record or a D.SLIP.FMT record can be entered. If a valid D.SLIP.FMT then the system will provide an enrichment from the record so the user will know thay have the correct record. Alternatively, an ENQUIRY record can be used to provide a Deal Slip, in this case the enrrichment will inform the user that an ENQUIRY record has been selected. The user can drilldown to the related table D.SLIP.FMT to view or select the record to use. The combination of the associated fields is used to define when the Deal Slip can be produced.
To trigger them automatically you need to define:

Field#Content Required##
D.SLIP.FMT#TELLER.SLIP.INPUT##
D.SLIP.FUNC#I##
This will only print the Deal Slip 'TELLER.SLIP.INPUT' when the deal is validated at I(nput) time.

To trigger them via a 'hot key' or the Desktop Deal Slip icon you need

Field#Content Required##
D.SLIP.FMT#TELLER.SLIP.INPUT##
D.SLIP.FUNC#I##

This will only print the Deal Slip 'TELLER.SLIPPUT' at I(nput) time when the 'hot key' is used
Note: ENQUIRY linked Deal Slips are valid for Desktop (GUI) use only. Since the ENQUIRY will be based on either the live or unauthorised file then only data that is available on those files can be accessed, whereas D.SLIP.FMT can utilise the new data being entered on a deal. ENQUIRY deal slips therefore need to be based on the live or unauthorised record depending on when the deal slip is being produced. For example a new deal would probably be based on the unauthorised record whereas a reversal would be based on the live record.

Validation Rules

Input to this field must be a valid record in either ENQUIRY or D.SLIP.FMT files.

Must have values in fields D.SLIP.FUNC.

If the version record has no value for DEAL.SLIP.TRIGGER, then it is defaulted to RQ.
