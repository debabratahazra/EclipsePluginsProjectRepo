	/* The main file within this module, FRA.DEAL, is split into 3 distinct parts.
Part one stores the basic elements, either input or table generated defaults, essential to the FRA processing.  Such details are; Counterparty ID, rates, type of FRA (Hedge or Trade), dates (Start, maturity and trade), and additionally, where appropriate, Broker ID's, commissions and charges and calculation parameters.
The second part of the record facilitates the settlement of the FRA deal, when, on rate fixing day, the prevailing settlement rate is input and actioned accordingly.  Settlement accounts, addresses and relevant narratives for the delivery/receipt of advices and payments are picked up from here.
The third part stores the internally generated fields, providing accrual information, LCY equivalents of amount fields, status on advices and payments sent, and references to consolidation of generated transactions. */

The Reference Number will be shown on all output generated from the transaction and will be generated automatically when specified as such in the Company table for the Future Rate Agreement Application. Otherwise, it will need to be entered for each transaction and subsequently checked by the System for uniqueness.
To avoid the necessity to input the complete Reference Number, the User has the facility to input only the sequence number of the transaction to access any transaction which has been input that day. The Application will automatically generate the seven first digits and append them to the front of the sequence number in order to retrieve the requested transaction.
Access to any FRA transaction from a previous day requires the input of the corresponding julian day and the year if the contract has been done in a previous year.

HEDGE  <-------->  TRADING
A distinction is made between the two in order to allow different accounting procedures to be implemented and for the timing of the recognition of profits and losses and as to when they are to be incorporated into the balance sheet.

HEDGE Transactions
Because the maturity dates of deposits and other sources of funds available in the market do not always sufficiently match the maturity of banks' assets, bankers make use of interest rate hedging instruments to reduce their interest gap exposure to acceptable limits.  The FRAs have become today a popular alternative to Financial Futures as a means of hedging interest rate exposure. In order for a bank to enter into a FRA for hedging purposes, the following conditions will apply:
1. The bank must have net assets or liabilities which are subject to          interest rate risk. This condition must exist after commitments          and anticipated transactions reducing the risk have been taken          into account.
2. The FRA transaction must be designated as a hedge and must reduce          the interest rate risk on exposed assets and liabilities.
As it can be seen, a conscious decision is done at deal level and since FRAs may be tailored into individual requirements, it is easier for such a trade to qualify as a hedge than for normal exchange governed Financial Futures.

TRADING Transactions
Apart from Hedging facilities, bankers will operate for other purposes such as general trading and arbitrage. Since such activities may be deemed to be of a more speculative nature, the concept of revaluing such positions is of importance.
In order to allow the segregation of the above trade concepts, the input of trades requires the inclusion of the type of trade. This will allow the system to distinguish trades into their relevant categories both for accounting purposes and for revaluing.

(v)  BEN.BANK2 may be an ACCOUNT WITH Bank (ie. the final             destination of the funds) but may NOT be an INTERMEDIARY bank.
(vi)  BANK.ADDR may be an ACCOUNT WITH Bank (i.e. the  final             destination of the funds) or it may be an INTERMEDIARY Bank             which will pass the funds on to a second bank. It is only             used if no customer ID is available.
At contract loading, if the INTERMEDIARY Bank is identified in BEN.BANK1, then the ACCOUNT WITH Bank must be input either directly at BEN.BANK2 or within BANK.ADDR in which case the system will automatically apply it to BEN BANK2.
Otherwise, when the INTERMEDIARY Bank is identified within BANK.ADDR - (and is thus automatically applied to BEN.BANK1) then the ACCOUNT WITH Bank must be identified in BEN.BANK2.

		/* A sub-value number generated automatically by the system which identifies either a statement entry or a category entry in respect of a contract.
The system will automatically insert a number into this field and this number may refer to a statement entry or a category entry depending on the value contained in the corresponding multivalue fields. The following examples will illustrate the use of this field.
Example 1:           On the start date of a FRA contract there will be an entry on           the Settlement Account and the following type of number will be           generated at this field:
SV1 STMT.NO ........... 673732684.48           SV2 STMT.NO ........... 1
The number automatically generated in S.V.1 is unique to the           contract in question and is built in the following way:
1. The first four digits '6737' indicate the number of days              since the 1st of January 1968. In our example, it corresponds              to the 11th of June 1986.
2. The next five digits '32684' indicate the number of seconds              since midnight. In our example, it corresponds to an entry              generated on line at 09:04:44 AM.
3. The last two digits '48' indicate the number of hundreds of              seconds.
The value assigned (again automatically) to S.V.2 identifies              the number in S.V.1 as a statement entry number. If the user              wishes to call this statement entry record on to the screen              the user will invoke the STMT.ENTRY Application and then type              the following at 'AWAITING ID':
67372684.480001
where the suffix '0001' identifies it as the first              statement entry (there may be more than one as the next              example will illustrate).

Example 2:           A second example outlined here is similar to example 1 in that           there is a statement entry on start date for both the           Settlement Account and the CHG/COM Acct. The system handles this           case as follows:
SV.1   STMT.NO ........... 673732684.48           SV.2   STMT.NO ........... 1-2
Once again S.V.1 contains the identification number           automatically generated by the system while S.V.2 now contains           two separate numbers signifying that there are in fact two           separate statement entries, one in respect of the Settlement           Account and one in respect of the CHG/COM Acct. If the user           wishes to see either of these he must first of all invoke           STMT.ENTRY followed by the desired function and then at           'AWAITING ID' type either:
673732684.480001
where the addition of the suffix '0001' identifies the           statement entry in respect of the settlement account or,
673732684.480002
where the addition of the suffix '0002' identifies the           statement entry in respect of the CHG/COM ACCT.

Example 3:           A third example might be that of a category entry generated at           initiation of a contract where commission or charges have been           debited to the customer and credited to a profit and loss           category code. In this case the following entries are generated           on the contract:
SV1 STMT.NO ............... 673732684.48           SV3 STMT.NO ............... 1
Once again the standard type number is generated and inserted at           S.V.1.
Now, however, S.V.2 is replaced by S.V.3 which now identifies           the number in S.V.1 as a category entry and not a statement           entry.
To call this category entry record onto the screen the user must           now type:
CATEG.ENTRY at 'AWAITING APPLICATION'
followed by:
673732684.480001 at 'AWAITING ID'

	FRA_DEAL__OVERRIDE
	{
		/* Contains all the override messages which the user agreed to during input.
During the validation stage of a FRA contract, the system may provide the user with a series of screen override messages to indicate an anomaly, for instance, that the interest rate varies by more thatn the variation tolerance defined in the FRA parameters table.
In the event that the user confirms the Override, the full text of the actual Override Message will be stored, for reference purposes on in this multivalue field.
For example, if the user inserts an 'abnormal' interest rate in the field corresponding to the interest rate then when the deal is validated a warning bell will sound and a message will appear, at the foot of the screen, which reads:
'VARIANCE OF RATE EXCEEDS PERMITTED TOLERANCE'
This will draw the user's attention to the rate entered, which may be a mistake and can then be corrected, or, on the other hand, it may be correct input and so the user confirms that this rate is really intended.
A second example might be in respect of a contract done with a client who has a credit line established with the bank but where the start date of the intended FRA contract goes beyond the credit line expiry date. In this case when the deal is validated a warning bell will sound and a message will appear, at the foot of the screen, which reads:
'LINE EXPIRES BEFORE TXN START DATE'
Once again the user's attention is drawn to the situation and either corrected or conrimed via a positive response to the Override Message.
If, subsequently, the contract record is either fully displayed or printed, then all override messages will be present.
