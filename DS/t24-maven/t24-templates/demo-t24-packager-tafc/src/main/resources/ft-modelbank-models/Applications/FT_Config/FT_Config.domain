A Customer which is to be subjected to these conditions, must first meet the selection criteria defined in FT.General.Condition and accessed via an identical key.  The special conditions which can be defined at the Group level can be divided into 4 categories:
1) Exchange Spread
The Currency Table contains the standard conditions applicable           to the Exchange spread to be taken on transactions involving           conversion of Currencies.
2) Commissions
The Commission Type table contains the standard conditions           applicable to all types of commissions which can be used in the           Funds Transfer Application.
3) Charges
The Charge Type table contains the standard conditions           applicable to all types of charges which can be used in the           Funds Transfer Application.
Note : By using the Group Condition table the User can define more        favourable conditions for the Group of Customers by indicating,        e.g., that only 50%, 25%  of the normal spread/commission/charge is        applicable.
4) Value Date
The Transaction Type Condition table contains the standard           Customer Value Date conditions according to each Transaction           Type existing in the Funds Transfer Application.  Again by means           of Group Condition table, the User can define different           conditions for the Group of Customers if for any reason, the           bank wants to apply specific Value Date conditions.
As an additional facility,  this file will also allow the User to indicate if the charges have to be booked as a separate entry.

	/* This table defines the default conditions for each Transaction Type which can be processed by the Funds Transfer and Standing Orders Application. These can be summarised as follows:
Transaction Codes
The Transaction Codes to be used for the generation of the            entries.  Both Debit and Credit Transaction Codes will be            defined for basic entries, standing orders, debit charges and            cheques.

Commission Types
The default Commission Types applicable for each Transaction            Type.  These Commission Types must first have been defined in            the Commission Type table.

Charge Types
The default Charge Types applicable for each Transaction type.            These Charge Types must have been previously created in the            CHARGE.TYPE table.

Maximum Forward and Back Value Date
The Maximum Forward and Back Value dates applicable for each            transaction type must be specified and any excess beyond these            value dates will force an override at the transaction level.

Default Value Dates for the Accounting Entries
The default Value Date conditions may be held for each            Transaction type.  The conditions for both debit and credit            entries are catered for, i.e the User can specify for each            Transaction type, the Value Date conditions applicable to the            bank and to the Customer.

Production of Advices
For a given transaction type, the production of Debit and            Credit advices by default, can be controlled.
The default conditions defined in this table will only be used by the Funds Transfer Application, during validation of the transaction, if specific values have not been manually entered during the transaction input stage.
Amendments to this table will only take effect after the user has next signed on to the system. */

There are obvious differences between a simple Account Transfer and a fully detailed International Electronic Payment involving many counterparties so the options in each can differ and need unique options, this record allows those options to be configured as required.
Whilst there are standard codes which can be used (as detailed in the table below) it is also possible for the user to define custom codes. These can be up to 4 characters but must have the first 2 characters of one of the standard codes.
For example the code OT can be used for standard Outward Payments, whilst OTSW allows the option to specify BIC codes on and OT03 sends an MT103 instead of an MT100.
