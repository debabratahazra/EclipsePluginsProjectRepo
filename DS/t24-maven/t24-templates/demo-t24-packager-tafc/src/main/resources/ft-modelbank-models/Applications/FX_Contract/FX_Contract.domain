	/* Foreign Exchange is a stand-alone Module which is fully integrated within T24. to provide a total banking service.  It has been specifically designed to meet the growing needs of any current day dealing operation which is trading within the Foreign Exchange Market.  Such demands encompass the accurate recording of all types of SPOT, FORWARD (with option delivery facility) and SWAP transactions, limiting Exposure, Position updating, control and actual administration of the trading activity together with ensuring efficient delivery of the related Advices, Confirmations and Payments.
The main deal types handled can be classified as follows:

Spot Contract
The buying or selling of foreign currency at spot exchange rates for prompt delivery.  (Normally within seven calendar days of the date the contract is made unless a shorter period is customary or required in the local market).

Forward Contract
The buying or selling of foreign currency at future exchange rates for delivery in the future i.e. at a date greater than the locally defined spot date.

Option Contract
The buying or selling of foreign currency at future exchange rates where the delivery may take place at any time between two specified dates of the customer's choice without incurring any penalty costs.  This option occurs when the customer decides to take delivery of all, or part of, the transaction before the final value date. A further facility within this is the Multiple Rate Option Contract where different rates are specified for periods within the life the contract.

Swap Contract
Exchange of currencies at the spot rate with an agreement to reverse the transaction with an identical amount of currency at a later date at a specified rate.  Both transactions are usually, but not necessarily, done with the same counterparty.
Contract types such as Antespot, Tom-Next or Spot-Next are by-products of the above mentioned deal types.
The main features of the Module can be described as follows:
1. Input and Processing
Input of deals can be at two levels with the dealers directly       inputting the key elements of their deals (currencies, amounts,       value date and counterparty) as the first level which can then be       later enriched (delivery instructions, settlement details etc.) by       the back-office as the second level.  This avoids the necessity of       raising hand written deal tickets and ensures the 'real time' state       of the various positions maintained, (i.e. immediately after input       by the dealer the counterparty's liability/exposure, the exchange       position and daily Foreign Exchange movements will include this       deal).
Almost all elements of Foreign Exchange transactions, with the       exception of the key information entered by the dealer, have default       values.  Thus, for any given counterparty, payment methods and       instructions are loaded automatically from a user definable table       and need only be confirmed or, exceptionally, amended by the       back-office.
The ability to arrive at intelligent defaults also has another       benefit in that for Swaps nearly all information on the second leg       can be derived from the first leg.  Information that needs to be       input by the dealer is thus reduced to a minimum.
The transaction processing sequence for Foreign Exchange deals is       that on input (first/dealer level) all positions are updated and the       dealer may assume the deal has been effectively processed. After       completion of the input by the back-office (second level) the       authorisation stage will then give rise to the generation and       delivery of confirmations, the passing of any accounting entries       such as brokerage, commissions and charges, and the issue of any       required pay/receive instructions.  Otherwise, there are 'overnight'       processes which handle eventual settlement, revaluation and accruals       and various reporting activities.
2. Inquiries and Positions
In common with other T24. Applications all data can be enquired       upon or selectively analysed and researched.  The Application       maintains the overall exchange position for the bank with       appropriate enquiry facilities. */

		/* Identifies each Foreign Exchange transaction.
The Reference Number will be shown on all output generated from the transaction and will be generated automatically when specified as such in the Company table for the Foreign Exchange Application.  Otherwise, it will need to be entered for each transaction and subsequently checked by the System for uniqueness.
To avoid the necessity to input the complete Reference Number, the User has the facility to input only the sequence number of the transaction to access any transaction which has been input that day.  The Application will automatically generate the seven first digits and append them to the front of the sequence number in order to retrieve the requested transaction.  Access to any Foreign Exchange transaction from a previous day requires the input of the corresponding julian day and the year if the contract has been done in a previous year.
The reference number has the following format FXYYDDDNNNNN where:
FX = Application indicator for the Foreign Exchange Application.
YY = The last two digits of the year when the transaction is               processed
DDD = Julian day number within year when the FX is processed.
NNNNN = Five digit sequential number.
The above numbering convention enables 99,999 deals to be struck on any one day.
Thus : FX8530500010 is the 10th Foreign Exchange transaction of the 2nd of November 1985, i.e:
. FX    = Foreign Exchange Application Id.       . 85    = Year 1985       . 305   = 2nd of November (305th day 1985)       . 00010 = 10th transaction on that day.
Validation Rules
10 numeric characters, prefixed by FX:             FXyydddnnnnn  FX followed by 10 numbers (see Details)  (Mandatory input)
If the Reference Number is entered, during initial input, it will be validated for uniqueness.
When input, this field will only be allowed in the format specified above.
This field can never be changed. */

		/* Identifies the nature of the Foreign Exchange deal being processed.  The application handles three different types:
- SP or S = Spot        - FW or F = Forward (Outright)        - SW      = Swap
The following deal types are processed by the Foreign Exchange application:

SP or S = Spot deals.
Spot deals involve the immediate exchange of one currency for another and, because these are usually the most common in the market, this deal type has been selected as the system default. To allow sufficient time for the bank to check details and transfer funds, the accepted standard for spot deals is two business days following the date of the transaction. The system allows this, or any other market standard, to be defined on the FX.PARAMETERS table.
The validation process will verify that the value date of the contract does not exceed the number of working days defined in the field SPOT.INTERNAL on the FX.PARAMETERS table.

FW or F = Forward deals
Forward contracts refer to the buying and selling of foreign currency at future exchange rates for delivery in the future, i.e. at a date greater than the locally defined spot date.  The period varies but usually would be for one, two, three, six, and twelve months hence.  When the value date of the contract exceeds the number of working days defined on the FX.PARAMETERS table in the field SPOT.INTERNAL, the contract will be considered as forward.

SW = Swap deals.
Swap deals involve the exchange of currencies at the spot rate with an agreement to reverse the transaction with an identical amount of currency at a later date at a specified rate.
Contract types such as Overnight (ON), Tom-Next (TN) or Spot-Next (SN) are by-products of this deal type.
To assist in entering the swap, details of the first leg - the spot leg - are carried forward to the subsequent -forward- leg.
A contract cannot be established on a forward/forward basis.
Validation Rules
1 or 2 alpha characters deal type  (Optional input; default = SP)
Only the above mentioned deal types will be accepted.

null = Normal
IN or I = Internal deal
BR or B = Broker deal (counterparty unknown)
This field is used to define deals which are internal or non-standard as they affect future validation/processing. The system is capable of handling the following sub-types:
null = Normal
If nothing is entered in this field, it is assumed that the deal type specified in field 1 is standard.
IN or I = Internal deal
Internal deals are handled differently from standard deals due to the fact that their only purpose is to allow transfers between different positions or dealer desks. Obviously, there is no need for accounting entries, payments, advices etc. When an internal spot or forward deal is entered, the system will automatically update the positions of both dealer desks entered into the contract (COUNTERPARTY and DEALER.DESK).
BR or B = Broker deal
Where trading has been carried out through a broker and the counterparty is not known, 'BR' should be entered as the sub-type. The system will then expect broker and not counterparty details to be entered. To authorise the contract, however, the user will need to erase 'BR' from this field and enter the counterparty details. A special enquiry facility allows the user to search, by broker, those contracts where the counterparty is still missing.

The counterparty is external and known to the dealer. Any counterparty existing on the Customer file will be accepted. The customer can be entered as a number or mnemonic. The liability number assigned to this counterparty in the customer file will be used for the limit checking.
BR Input in this field is not allowed for BRoker deals as it is assumed that initially the counterparty would not be known. When the counterparty is known, remove the BR from the DEAL.SUB.TYPE field and enter the customer details.
NE Where a deal has been NEgotiated or booked by another department, input is free form but specifically the dealer should enter details of the requesting department. For sub-types NE, no validation takes place.

The system caters for the need to have more than one market within a given currency.  The use of this field will only be applicable for those countries where the exchange market defines different rates for the same foreign Currency according to rules determined by the local authorities or local central bank.
A typical example would be Belgium where foreign currencies are quoted on the Regular Market and also on the Free Market.  Different sets of exchange rates will exist for these two markets.
If the default FX movement on MU.TXN.GRP.CCY.MKT is specified as 'FX' this field will not allow input and the value 1 will be defaulted.
If default movement is not specified as 'FX', then if DEAL movement type has been specified on MU.TXN.GRP.CCY.MKT the market specified will be defaulted ito this field and the field will be made no input.
If neither 'FX' is set or DEAL movement is specified, then input is mandatory in this field and may not be changed after authorisation.
It is possible to specify separate markets to be used for COMM.CHRG and BROKERAGE. Any commission or change entries generated will use the specified market for COMM.CHRG if set up and similary BROKERAGE entries will use the BROKERAGE market if set up. If not set up the DEFAULT MOVEMENT currency market will be taken. The system allows the user to view the Foreign Exchange position by currency market when more than one market is applicable.

-  the user-defined numeric currency code
For multi-leg deals, the currency details are automatically brought forward from the previous leg.
This field is mandatory and contains the currency code of the currency which is purchased. The code can be entered in one of two formats:
1) Alpha format - This code will then comprise three alpha          characters as defined in the currency table.  It is recommended          to use the standard SWIFT currency code which is the          internationally recognised convention for currency codes.  The          following are examples of ISO/SWIFT codes:
- USD = US Dollars          - GBP = Pounds Sterling          - DEM = Deutsche Marks          - FRF = French Francs
2) Numeric format - In most Treasury operations, certain currencies          are traded more often that others.  To continually enter a three          alpha character code would be unnecessarily time consuming.          Currencies may therefore be given a numeric ranking between 1 and          999 on the Currency table.  If USD is the most frequently traded          currency it should have a numeric code of 1.  Entering 1 will          then access the details of US dollars from the Currency table.
After the initial leg of a Swap deal has been entered, all further legs default to the currencies involved. For example, if dollars are purchased against Deutche Marks in the first leg, the default currency bought in subsequent legs will be Marks and no access to the field will be allowed.
Validation Rules
3 characters (uppercase alpha) - type SSS    or 1-3 numeric characters Currency Code  (Mandatory input)
The currency code entered must appear on the Currency table.
Currency bought and Currency sold may not have the same country identification (2 first letters of currency code).

		/* Contains the amount of the currency being purchased.  If no value is entered, the amount will be calculated automatically by the system as explained in the Details.
It is important to note that either the amount bought or amount sold must be entered. From this the other value can be calculated in the system's exchange rate routine. This routine can work in a number of ways:
1. If one amount and the exchange rate are entered, the routine          calculates the other amount.
2. If both amounts are entered, the routine calculates the exchange          rate.
3. When both amounts and the exchange rate are entered, the          correctness of the input is checked as follows:
i) the 1st amount input is recalculated from the 2nd amount and             the exchange rate.
ii) the difference between the amount input and the recalculated             amount is converted to local currency (using the mid-rate)             and compared with the minimum and maximum conversion             tolerances defined in the company record.
iii) if the difference is not greater than the minimum tolerance,             the input amount is accepted with no message.
iv) if the difference is greater than the minimum tolerance but             not greater than the maximum tolerance, an override message             is displayed, allowing the input amount to be accepted or             changed.
v) if the difference is greater than the maximum tolerance, the             amount input is replaced with the recalculated amount and an             override message is displayed, allowing the recalculated             amount to be accepted or changed.
The currency of the deal will dictate the format of the amount.  For example 1285.75 is a valid amount in US dollars but it is not acceptable in Japanese Yen as there is no smaller denomination (i.e. there are no decimal places).  The number of decimal places is specified for each currency in the Currency table and the amount entered will be validated against this.
To assist in entry, the operator may input T for Thousand and M for Million.  Entering 10T, therefore, will result in 10,000.00 being displayed if the currency has been defined with two decimals.
Validation Rules
Standard T24 amount validation.  The actual format will depend on the number of decimal places in the currency being traded.
If this field is left blank the system will calculate the amount bought based on the amount sold and the exchange rate used.  The system expects either the amount bought or sold to be entered.
The amount must be an acceptable format for the currency (e.g. USD 1,000.123 would not be acceptable as the US dollar will surely have been defined with two decimals on the currency table).
The amount entered cannot be changed once the deal is authorised. */

		/* Indicates the value date applicable to the currency purchased. The liquidation of the Foreign Exchange contract will take place on the earliest date between the VALUE.DATE.BUY and the VALUE.DATE.SELL but taking into account the respective value dates.
The Foreign Exchange application has two separate fields in which to record a value date for the currency bought and the currency sold. In most foreign exchange deals the two dates will be identical as both currencies will be dealt under the same value. However, in foreign exchange deals where one Middle East currency is involved it will often happen that, due to differences in country holidays, the two currencies could be dealt with a one or two days difference in their value date. In this case a specific input will then be done in the two fields VALUE.DATE.BUY and VALUE.DATE.SELL. In order to enter a Forex deal for which the value dates are not the same as each other, one or both currencies of the deal must be defined in the field SPLIT.VALUE.CCY on the FX.PARAMETERS table.
If neither currency of the deal is listed on this table, any input to the field VALUE.DATE.BUY will automatically be assigned to the field VALUE.DATE.SELL and vice versa. If no input is done in the field VALUE.DATE.SELL, it will then default automatically to the value of the field VALUE.DATE.BUY.
This date will be compared with the deal date to identify if the deal is a spot or forward contract. The classification of the deal as 'Spot' or 'Forward' will depend on the number of days defined in the field SPOT.INTERNAL on the FX.PARAMETERS table.
The calculation of default spot date is also controlled by the FX.PARAMETERS fields FX.LCL.REGION and SPOT.BASE.CCY which allow the use of alternative or additional holiday tables.
Where an OPTION.DATE is entered, it is this option date and not the VALUE.DATE.BUY entered in this field which is used to identify if the contract is to be classified as Spot or Forward.
To ease user input, the following abbreviations will also be allowed:
T = Todays date
TO = Tomorrow
S = Spot date as defined in the field Spot Market on the FX.PARAMETERS table.
ON = Refers to a two leg SWAP contract where the value date on the first leg is equal to today's date and the value date on the second leg is equal to the next working day. The abbreviation 'ON' stands for 'OverNight'.
TN = Refers to a two leg SWAP contract where the value date on the first leg is equal to the next working day and the value date on the second leg is equal to the following working day. The abbreviation 'TN' stands for 'Tom Next' i.e. 'Tomorrow - Next'.
SN = Refers to a two leg SWAP contract where the value date on the first leg is equal to the spot date (see above) and the value date on the second leg is equal to the following working day. The abbreviation 'SN' stands for 'Spot Next'.
NNA = Where NN is the number of days or months and A is either 'D' for calendar days, 'W' for working days or 'M' for months. Examples:
IOD = 10 calendar days forward (from Spot) 10W = 10 working days forward (from Spot) 6M = 6 months forward (from spot)
Validation Rules
The date may be entered in the standard date format or as one of the abbreviations explained in the details. (Input is mandatory for forward deals; otherwise input is optional).
The date must be in an acceptable format (see general formats).
A date less than today is not allowed except for Spot deals. Where the date entered is more than one day back value or more than one year forward value, an override is required.
The date must be reasonable for the type of deal. In other words the validation process will check the deal date with the contract value date and compare the number of days with the value defined in the field SPOT.INTERNAL on the FX.PARAMETERS table. The deal type (FW or SP) must then be in agreement with the value defined in the table.
The date must be a working day in the country (region '00') of the currency being traded.
The forward leg of Swap deals must have a value date later than the Spot leg.
The value date cannot be earlier than the deal date.
Where the buy and sell value date are different an override will be required.
The value date must not be earlier than the option date.
The value date must not be earlier than the permitted maximum back-value period.
The values 'ON', 'TN' and 'SN' will only be accepted when the Deal Type is equal to 'SW', i.e. it concerns a swap deal. In Swap deals where ON, TN or SN is specified on the first leg, access to this field will not be allowed on the forward leg.
Input of the date is mandatory for forward contracts. With the input of ON, TN and SN, value dates on the first leg must be the same for the currency bought and the currency sold.
Once the contract has been authorised the value date cannot be amended. */

		/* Indicates the value date applicable to the currency sold. The liquidation of the Foreign Exchange contract will take place on the earliest date between the VALUE.DATE.BUY and the VALUE.DATE.SELL but taking into account the respective value dates.
The Foreign Exchange application has two separate fields in which to record a value date for the currency bought and for the currency sold. In most foreign exchange deals the two dates will be identical as both currencies will be dealt under the same value. However, in foreign exchange deals where one Middle East currency is involved it will often happen that, due to differences in country holidays, the two currencies could be dealt with a one or two days difference in their value date. In this case a specific input will then be done in the two fields VALUE.DATE.BUY and VALUE.DATE.SELL. in order to enter a Forex deal for which the value dates are not the same as each other, one or both currencies of the deal must be defined in the field SPLIT.VALUE.CCY on the FX.PARAMETERS table.
If neither currency of the deal is listed on this table, any input to the field VALUE.DATE.BUY will automatically be assigned to the field VALUE.DATE.SELL and vice versa. If no input is done in the field VALUE.DATE.SELL, it will then default automatically to the VALUE.DATE.BUY.
This date will be compared with the deal date to identify if the deal is a spot or forward contract. The classification of the deal as 'Spot' or 'Forward' will depend on the number of days defined in the field SPOT.INTERNAL on the FX.PARAMETERS table.
The calculation of default spot date is also controlled by the FX.PARAMETERS fields FX.LCL.REGION and SPOT.BASE.CCY which allow the use of alternative and additional holiday tables.
Where an OPTION.DATE is entered, it is this option date and not the VALUE.DATE.SELL entered in this field which is used to identify if the contract is to be classified as Spot or Forward.
To ease user input, the following abbreviations will also be allowed:
T = Todays date
TO = Tomorrow
S = Spot date as defined in the field SPOT MARKET on the FX.PARAMETERS table.
ON = Refers to a two leg SWAP contract where the value date on the first leg is equal to today's date and the value date on the second leg is equal to the next working day. The abbreviation 'ON' stands for 'OverNight'.
TN = Refers to a two leg SWAP contract where the value date on the first leg is equal to the next working day and the value date on the second leg is equal to the following working day. The abbreviation 'TN' stands for 'Tom Next' i.e. 'Tomorrow next'.
SN = Refers to a two leg SWAP contract where the value date on the first leg is equal to the spot date (see above) and the value date on the second leg is equal to the following working day. The abbreviation 'SN' stands for 'Spot Next'.
NNA = Where NN is the number of days or months and A is either 'D' for calendar days, 'W' for working days or 'M' for months. Examples: IOD = 10 calendar days forward (from Spot) 10W = 10 working days forward (from Spot) 6M = 6 months forward (from Spot)
Validation Rules
The date may be entered in the standard date format or as one of the abbreviations explained in the details. (Input is optional; Default value = VALUE.DATE.BUY)
The date must be in an acceptable format (see general formats).
A date less than today is not allowed except for Spot deals. Where the date entered is more than 1 day back value or more than one year forward value, an override is required.
The date must be reasonable for the type of deal. In other words the validation process will check the deal date with the contract value date and compare the number of days with the value defined in the field SPOT.INTERNAL on the FX.PARAMETERS table.
The deal type (FW or SP) must then be in agreement with the value defined in the table.
The date must be a working day in the country (region '00') of the currency being traded.
The forward leg of Swap deals must have a value date later than the Spot leg.
The value date cannot be earlier than the deal date.
Where the buy and sell value date are different an override will be required.
The value date must not be earlier than the option date.
The value date must not be earlier than the permitted maximum back-value period.
The values 'ON', 'TN' and 'SN' will only be accepted when the Deal Type is equal to 'SW' i.e. it concerns a swap deal. In swap deals where ON, TN or SN is specified on the first leg, access to this field will not be allowed on the forward leg.
Once the contract has be authorised the value date cannot be amended. */

		/* Identifies the spot exchange rate between the currency bought and currency sold.
Spot transactions involve an immediate exchange of one currency for another, and most foreign exchange transactions are of this type. The exchange rate (the price of one currency in terms of another) used on these transactions is known as the spot rate. To allow banks sufficient time to check details and transfer funds, the 'standard' spot value is two business days following the day the deal was struck. This is specified on the FX.PARAMETERS table. Spot may also be defined on this table for internal and central bank reporting. For all spot transactions, input in this field will be mandatory as it represents the contract rate which will be printed on the confirmation sent to the counterparty.
For Forward contracts (outright) or Swap contracts (forward leg) using the revaluation method 'SL' (straight line), 'IN' (Interest) or 'IH' (interest/hedged), the spot rate (input or defaulted) will be used to determine and isolate the apparent exchange Profit or Loss amount at the start of the transaction.
This exchange Profit or Loss amount will then be amortised over the life of the transaction as a daily accrual between the appropriate interest Profit and Loss category code [Interest Paid Exchange (Category Code 50000) if contract is done at a loss and Interest Received Exchange (Category code 51000) if contract is done at a Profit] and the exchange reserve adjustment internal account. The forward foreign exchange deal will then be carried at spot rate (since the forward rate premium or discount is being amortised/accrued) and, therefore will be revalued each day as if it was a spot deal.
The system will check that the rate entered is within the tolerance specified on the Currency table and that the amount bought, amount sold and the rate itself are complementary. (see AMOUNT.BOUGHT)
Validation Rules
1-12 type R (Standard Rate Format - up to 8 integer and 6 decimal) characters plus a decimal point or 1-15 type R (Up to 8 integer and 9 decimal) characters plus a decimal point when EXTENDED.PREC in SPF is set to Y. (Mandatory input except for Forward contracts.) The rate must be in an acceptable format. The rate will be checked against that on the Currency table. If outside the specified tolerance the operator will be asked to confirm the rate by means of entering an override. The rate, amount bought, and amount sold must be complimentary.

		/* Identifies the exchange rate applicable to forward deals. The rate may be entered in full or as a 'premium-discount' over the spot rate. A '+' should be entered to signify a premium and a '-' for discount.
Forward transactions are those with value dates further in the future than spot deals, usually for periods of one, two, three, six, and twelve months. These transactions involve an agreement to exchange currencies at an agreed rate on a specified future date. By entering into such a transaction, exchange risks can be avoided as the rate and settlement date remain the same regardless of what happens to the exchange rate.
The actual forward rate, agreed at the time of the contract, is determined by the interest rates in the currencies concerned. For example, if dollar interest rates are 10% per annum and sterling 15%, it would be sensible to invest dollars in sterling and create a forward contract to re-purchase the dollars. However, the sterling forward exchange rate against dollar would be around 5% lower to reflect the interest rate difference between the two currencies.
In the example, Sterling is worth less in the future in terms of dollars because it is the currency with the higher interest rate; sterling is said to be at a discount to dollars. As future dollars are worth more because of the interest rates differential, they are said to be at a premium in terms of sterling.
The rate can be entered in this field as an actual forward exchange rate or as a premium/discount (identified with a preceeding + or -) which will then be added/subtracted to the spot rate defined in the previous field. If the spot rate is 2.00 and the forward rate 1.90, the forward rate can be entered as the 1.90 or as -.10 (i.e. a discount of .10 from the spot rate).
Premium/discount is expressed as 'pips' which are defined on the Currency table for each currency. If, for example, +12 is entered as the premium on dollars and the Currency table shows a pip value of 4, the system will view this as a premium of 0.0012 to be added on the spot rate to derive the forward rate.

A swap transaction is a contract to buy and sell a currency against another currency with different settlement dates for the two deals.
For example, a dealer might decide to sell USD 1,000,000.00 for DEM 2,300,000.00 value spot and buy them back in 6 months time.

		/* Contains the limit reference number for the counterparty.
The reference can be entered by the operator or left blank.  If left blank the system will provide the default Limit reference number for FOREX deals.
The Limit system covers two main types of exposure as far as the FOREX application is concerned. These are:
1. Overall Foreign Exchange Limit
Each deal is monitored against the overall foreign exchange limit of       the respective counterparty to ensure that the bank is not overly       exposed to this specific counterparty.  This overall Foreign       Exchange Limit can furthermore be sub-divided to allow definition of       Time bands. This would allow to define different limits for Spot and       Forward dealing.
2. Clean Risk or Delivery Risk Limit
The clean risk limit is the maximum allowable value of foreign       exchange transactions from the same counterparty to mature on any       single day.  For example, the bank may be prepared to have an       Overall Foreign Exchange limit of GBP 20 Million with a given       counterparty, but may want to limit the delivery risk on any one day       to GBP 5 Million.
The system does allow for netting of the Overall Foreign Exchange Limit for opposing deals with the same counterparty when the two opposing deals involve the same two currencies and mature on the same day. For example, if the bank buys USD 100,000 from a counterparty for GBP 70,000 to be settled on 31st December and then sells USD 50,000 to the same counterparty for GBP 35,000 to be settled on the same day (December 31st), the net effect would be an overall foreign exchange exposure of USD 50,000.
Note that within this approach the Clean Risk is never netted.

		/* Identifies the position type applicable to the foreign exchange transaction.  This facility is not used at present.
Typically any bank will maintain a 'TRADING' position which will reflect the net position of all dealing and back office activity.  On the other side, the management of the bank could also decide, from time to time, to take a position outside the normal trading activity and which consequently will not be included in the day to day trading activity and position but instead in a separate position which will generally be called 'Management' position.  This position will then be under the exclusive control of the management itself and will only consist of a very small number of foreign exchange deals (1 or 2).  For the dealing room trader this management position will be transparent as it is normally outside his area of responsibility.
Any foreign exchange deal where the position type 'Management' has been indicated, must be classified as internal and will update at the same time and in the opposite sense the Management position and the Trading position.  The foreign exchange dealer will then make a second deal in the market to cover his own trading position.  Only the Management position will then exist at this stage.  When management decides to liquidate or undo this position, the reverse operation will take place.
Before a type can be entered it must first be created on the FX Pos Type table.
Example: Let us suppose that the management believes that the U.S. dollar will go down against the Deutsche Mark in the near future and that, for this reason, decides to sell one month forward 10 million dollars against Deutsche Mark.  The following deals will then be created:
1) Internal deal between trader and management.  The trader will buy          dollars from management and sell Deutsche Mark to management          which consequently will be short in dollars and long in Deutsche          Marks. To keep the cost of the trading position intact, the          exchange rate applicable to this transaction will normally be the          rate agreed in the next deal (external deal).
2) The trader, to keep intact his trading position will make an          opposite contract in the market for the same amount, rate and          maturity date.          The following position will then exist across the books of the          bank:
Trading Position          ----------------                     DEM                     USD          - = SELL to management       + = BUY from management          + = BUY from the market      - = SELL in the market          _______________________      _______________________              SQUARE POSITION              SQUARE POSITION

Management Position          -------------------                     DEM                     USD          + = BUY from trader          - = SELL to trader          ______________________       _____________________                Long in DEM                Short in USD
During the revaluation process, separate accounting entries will be generated for the Management position to strictly isolate any exchange Profit or Loss which will result from this position.

'RB' = Rebate method       'SL' = Straight line       'IN' = Interest method       'IH' = Interest/hedged       'SF' = Straight line funding
As it is the case for the spot contracts all open forward Foreign Exchange contracts are revalued on an individual deal basis using the current market rates.  The forward rates used for the rebate revaluation are obtained from the FORWARD.RATE Table and where a rate is not available for a particular value date it is calculated by interpoltation, or the exchange rate of the nearest date will be selected according to the value defined on the REVALUATION.PARAMETER table.  For the revaluation applicable to unmatured forward contracts, T24, allows the user to choose, at deal level, between five different methods.

Rebate Method
This is the most straightforward method as it is based (like the spot revaluation) on the cost or profit attributable to closing the position, i.e. to enter into a deal at today's rates to exactly cover each deal at its maturity (buy back approach).
In the case of forward deals, the rate varies not only because of change in the market (supply and demand factors) but also because rates vary with time.  For any given forward deal, as it ages, the rate to cover it, converges with the spot rate as it gets closer to maturity, until it will, eventually be covered at spot rate.
Given a set of forward rates (FORWARD.RATES tables), the user can still choose between 3 methods to find the forward rate applicable to each forward contract, i.e:
- Interpolation       - Next available rate       - Closest rate
His choice will be indicated on the REVALUATION.PARAMETER table.  The following explains how the interpolation works within FOREX.  It is the only method where a rate will be found for each day.

Interpolation of forward Exchange Rates
The rates on the forward exchange rate table (FORWARD.RATES) can be defined for any period required by the user, (e.g. 1 week, 2 weeks, 15 days, 1 month, 2 months, 3 months etc..).
The actual value date that the forward rates apply to are calculated as the:                  Reporting date            +     2 working days            +     number of months.
If this date is not a working day, then the next working day is used.
When a date is required for a value date that falls between the dates of two rates on the table, then it is interpolated as follows:
a) Number of days bbetween the dates of the two rates:
TOTALDAYS = Latest Rate Date - Earliest Rate Date
b) Difference between rates:
DIFFERENCE = Latest Rate - Earliest Rate
c) Rate of change per day:
RATE OF CHANGE = DIFFERENCE                           ----------                           TOTALDAYS
d) The number of days to the required value date from the earliest          date is multiplied by the rate of change, then the result is          added to the earliest rate:
DAYS = Required Value Date - Earliest Rate Date
REQUIRED RATE = Earliest Rate + DAYS * RATEOFCHANGE

Straight Line Method
As previously stated, there is generally a difference between spot and forward rates.  Under the straight line distribution method, this difference, as an amount in local currency, is isolated as a profit or loss at the start of the contract and then simply amortised over the life of the deal as a daily accrual between the appropriate interest profit and loss category code (Interest Paid Exchange or Interest Received Exchange) and the exchange reserve adjustment account.  (ACCOUNT.CLASS file = RESERVE).
Effectively this deal is now being carried at spot rate (since the forward discount or premium is being accrued) and therefore, it is necessary to revalue it each day just as if it was a spot deal using the technique described in 'Spot Revaluation'.

Interest Method
The primary factor, influencing the change of forward rates with time, is the real difference in the interest yield of one currency compared with that of the currency for which it is planned to exchange.
Example : Assume the yield on GBP is 12% and that on USD is 14%                 with a Spot rate of 1.25.  Then, over 12 months
GBP 1000 would yield GBP 120 interest.
Likewise, if exchanged (@1.25)
USD 1250 would yield USD 175 interest.
Thus, in order not to sustain a loss, the 12 month Forward USD sell rate should be (USD 1425/GBP1120) or 1.2723.  i.e.
USD 1425 * 1.2723 = GBP 1120
In practice, one of the amounts on the Forward deal is held at the same value as for the Spot deal.  So, in this example, if the forward deal is also for GBP 1000 the USD amount would be USD 1275 (i.e. USD 1250 plus 2% interest differential thereon of USD 25).
Therefore, it is argued that the Discount on the forward USD 12 month rate is simply to offset the 2% USD interest premium prevailing at the time of the deal.
This apparent exchange Profit or Loss, therefore, should be accrued over the life of the forward deal as in the manner of the straight line method except that Profit and Loss Interest entries will now be booked for both the currency bought (credit to Interest Received Exchange) and the currency sold (debit to Interest Paid Exchange).
Using the same example:
A loan of USD 1250 yields USD 175 over 12 months.  Over the same time a debit (revaluation) accrual is made of USD 25 (i.e. USD 1250 * 2%).  Thus the net result is interest received of USD 150.
As proof that this is correct, GBP 1000 at 12% would have given rise to GBP 120 interest, which converted at spot of 1.25 is also USD 150.
The effect of this accrual (to discount the forward premium or discount) is to value the position at spot rate so it is, therefore, necessary each day to perform spot revaluation.
This method is obviously most appropriate to the transaction type 'Swap' where an actual loan and deposit could be booked with a spot and foward deal and the real interest rates can be used on the forward leg, so rendering the deal entirely neutral.  That is, the difference between interest paid and received will be eliminated by the forward accrual and the spot deal will be cancelled, in its effect, by the spot revaluation of the forward leg.

Interest/hedged Method
Like the interest method, this revaluation type takes into account the difference in the interest yield of one currency compared with that of the currency for which it is exchanged.  However, the interest/hedged method bases its interest calculations not on the actual amounts of the deal, but on a 'notional' principal amount on each side (buy & sell).
The notional principal amount is that amount which, given the interest rates applicable to each currency of the contract, would yield the actual amounts of the deal over the contract term.  In other words, the deal amounts are effectively split into a principal and interest element and it is this interest element which is accrued on each side of the deal over its life.
The difference between the interest and interest/hedged methods can be illustrated by example.
In all cases, the USD interest rate is 14% and the GBP interest rate is 12%.  The spot rate of exchange between the two currencies is 1.25. The forward rates refer to a 12-month forward contract.
Example 1 illustrates the figures which have been described under the interest method of revaluation.  Example 2 shows a similar deal using the interest/hedged method.  Finally, example 3 compares the results of trading a round GBP deal amount, method 'IH', against the original example, method 'IN'.
REVALUATION TYPE:        1) IN     2) IH     3) IH       USD 'principal':           n/a     1,250     1,116       GBP 'principal':           n/a     1,000       893       USD interest yield:      178.5       175       156       GBP interest yield:        120       120       107       USD deal amount:         1,275     1,425     1,272       GBP deal amount:         1,000     1,120     1,000       USD/GBP forward rate:    1.275    1.2723    1.2723
This method of calculating interest yields associated with a forward contract is appropriate to a hedging situation where a forward foreign exchange deal is made in cover of balance sheet items.
Because the notional principal amounts correspond to an actual spot transaction and are not the same as the resultant forward contract amounts, this revaluation type is not available for use on swap contracts (DEAL TYPE 'SW').

Straight Line Funding Method
This method is primarily for the Swap contract type and it is similar to the 'SL' method except that the premium/discount of a Swap is amortised over the life of the deal in the currency that it arises.
PM.PARAMETER needs to be changed to include the new position class if the SF reval type is defined on the file FX.REVAL.TYPE.

Most forward contracts have a specific value date.  However, commercial customers are not always sure exactly when money is to be received or paid. In these cases the customer may wish to enter into forward contracts allowing for an option period.
As an example, UK Ltd sells goods to USA Inc. and expects USD 100,000 in return.  In practice UK Ltd knows that USA Inc. takes between 4 and 6 weeks to pay. To enable them to establish how much is to be received, UK Ltd will enter into a 6 week forward contract with an option to settle in 4 weeks time.  The bank will quote the rate which is most favourable to them during the option period.
Often, when an option deal is set up, the customer will take his option in separate parts.  The Foreign Exchange Application allows the user to liquidate option deals in various transactions during the option period i.e. any number of partial deliveries will be allowed during the option period.

This local currency equivalent will be used when updating the currency position after successful validation.
When Foreign Exchange deals are first entered into the foreign currency position, the local currency equivalent for both the BUY.LCY.EQUIV and SEL.LCY.EQUIV depends on the revaluation method specified in the corresponding contract.  The following rules will be adhered to for each one of the revaluation methods below:

REBATE METHOD
The following rules will be followed:
a) When the contract involves local currency
It is always the local currency amount (AMOUNT.BOUGHT or       AMOUNT.SOLD) which will be used to generate the local currency       value in BOTH fields BUY.LCY.EQUIV and SEL.LCY.EQUIV.
b) When the contract does not involve local currency
The BASE amount of the contract will beconverted at contract       FORWARD.RATE and the forward rate of the other currency (non base       currency) to generate the local currency value in BOTH fields       BUY.LCY.EQUIV and SEL.LCY.EQUIV.
If for example:
SPOT  GBP/DEM          =   3,30       SPOT  GBP/USD          =   1,50       FWD 3 MONTH GBP/USD    =   1,48       FWD 3 MONTH GBP/DEM    =   3,24
the following local currency equivalents will be calculated by the       system for the next deals:
Deal 1       ------       Currency & Amount Bought : USD 1,000,000.00       Rate of Exchange         : 1.48       (Spot Rate)              :(1.50)       Currency & Amount Sold   : GBP 675,675.68       Value Date               : 6 Months       Dealer Desk              : 01       Revaluation Type         : RB       SPOT.LCY.AMT             : 666,666.67       BUY.LCY.EQUIV            :-675,675.68       SEL.LCY.EQUIV            : 675,675.68
Deal 2       ------       Currency & Amount Bought : USD 1,000,000.00       Rate of Exchange         : 2.18       (Spot Rate)              :(2.20)       Currency & Amount Sold   : DEM 2,180,000.00       Value Date               : 6 Months       Dealer Desk              : 02       Revaluation Type         : RB       SPOT.LCY.AMT             : 666,666.67       BUY.LCY.EQUIV            :-672,839.51       SEL.LCY.EQUIV            : 672,839.51

STRAIGHT LINE METHOD
The following rules will be followed:
a) When the contract involves local currency
- The local currency amount of the contract will be kept to         generate the local currency value in its corresponding         BUY.LCY.EQUIV or SEL.LCY.EQUIV, i.e:
if AMOUNT.BOUGHT  =  Local currency, then            AMOUNT.BOUGHT  =  BUY.LCY.EQUIV
if   AMOUNT.SOLD  =  Local currency, then              AMOUNT.SOLD  =  SEL.LCY.EQUIV
- The foreign currency amount of the contract will be converted at         at the contract SPOT.RATE to generate the local currency value in         its corresponding BUY.LCY.EQUIV or SEL.LCY.EQUIV.
b) When the contract does not involve local currency
- The BASE amount of the contract will be converted at the CURRENCY         table middle rate of the BASE currency to generate the local         currency value in its corresponding BUY.LCY.EQUIV or         SEL.LCY.EQUIV.
- The other foreign currency amount of the contract will be         converted at the contract SPOT.RATE and the CURRENCY table middle         rate of the BASE currency to generate the local currency value in         its corresponding BUY.LCY.EQUIV or SEL.LCY.EQUIV.
If for example:
SPOT   GBP/DEM         = 3,30         SPOT   GBP/USD         = 1,50
the following local currency equivalents will be calculated by         the system for the next deals:
Deal 1         ------         Currency & Amount Bought : USD 1,000,000.00         Rate of Exchange         : 1.48         (Spot Rate)              :(1.50)         Currency & Amount Sold   : GBP 675,675.68         Value Date               : 6 Months         Dealer Desk              : 01         Revaluation Type         : SL         SPOT.LCY.AMT             : 666,666.67         BUY.LCY.EQUIV            :-666,666.67         SEL.LCY.EQUIV            : 675,675.68
Deal 2         ------         Currency & Amount Bought : USD 1,000,000.00         Rate of Exchange         : 2.18         (Spot Rate)              :(2.20)         Currency & Amount Sold   : DEM 2,180,000.00         Value Date               : 6 Months         Dealer Desk              : 02         BASE Currency            : USD         Revaluation Type         : SL         SPOT.LCY.AMT             : 666,666.67         BUY.LCY.EQUIV            :-666,666.67         SEL.LCY.EQUIV            : 660,606.06

INTEREST & INTEREST/HEDGED METHODS
The same rules as the ones defined for the Straight Line method wiill be followed, i.e:
a) When the contract involves local currency
- The local currency amount of the contract will be kept to         generate the lcoal currency value in the corresponding         BUY.LCY.EQUIV or SELL.LCY.EQUIV, i.e:
if AMOUNT.BOUGHT  =  Local currency, then            AMOUNT.BOUGHT  =  BUY.LCY.EQUIV
if   AMOUNT.SOLD  =  Local currency, then              AMOUNT.SOLD  =  SEL.LCY.EQUIV
- The foreign currency amount of the contract will be converted at         the contract SPOT.RATE to generate the local currency value in         its corresponding BUY.LCY.EQUIV or SEL.LCY.EQUIV.
b) When the contract does not involve local currency
- the BASE amount of the contract will be converted at the CURRENCY         table middle rate of the BASE currency to generate the local         currency value in its corresponding BUY.LCY.EQUIV or         SEL.LCY.EQUIV.
- The other foreign currency amount of the contract will be         converted at the contract SPOT.RATE and the CURRENCY table middle         rate of the BASE currency to generate the local currency value in         its corresponding BUY.LCY.EQUIV or SEL.LCY.EQUIV.
If for example:
SPOT   GBP/DEM         = 3,30         SPOT   GBP/USD         = 1,50
the following local currency equivalents will be calculated by         the system for the next deals:
Deal 1         ------         Currency & Amount Bought : USD 1,000,000.00         Rate of Exchange         : 1.48         (Spot Rate)              :(1.50)         Currency & Amount Sold   : GBP 675,675.68         Value Date               : 6 Months         Dealer Desk              : 01         Revaluation Type         : IN         Interest rate buy        : 6.964504654         Interest rate sell       : 9.75         SPOT.LCY.AMT             : 666,666.67         BUY.LCY.EQUIV            :-666,666.67         SEL.LCY.EQUIV            : 675,675.68

SPOT CONTRACTS
The following rules will be followed:
a) Where either the actual amount bought or amount sold happens to          be in the local currency of the country (Deal 1), this amount          will be adopted as the local currency equivalent for the other          currency so that the fields BUY.LCY.EQUIV and SEL.LCY.EQUIV on          the main Foreign Exchange contract will contain this same value.          It is also this local currency value which will be used to          update the Foreign Exchange position once the deal has been          successfully validated.
b) Where the local currency is neither the currency bought nor the          currency sold (Deal 2), the system will calculate the local          currency equivalent of the BASE currency/amount and apply it to          both currencies of the contract so that fields BUY.LCY.EQUIV and          SEL.LCY.EQUIV on the main Foreign Exchange contract will also          contain the same value.          To calculate this local currency equivalent of the BASE amount,          the system will take the existing middle rate of the base          currency as defined on the CURRENCY table.  We have supposed          here that on the CURRENCY table the middle rate GBP/USD is equal          to 1,50.  Like in the previous case it is also this local          currency equivalent which will be used to update the Foreign          Exchange position once the deal has been successfully validated.
If for example:
SPOT   GBP/DEM         = 3,30          SPOT   GBP/USD         = 1,50
the following local currency equivalents will be calculated by          the system for the next deals:
Deal 1          ------          Currency & Amount Bought : USD 1,000,000.00          Rate of Exchange         : 1.5000          Currency & Amount Sold   : GBP 666,666.67          Value Date               : SPOT          Dealer Desk              : 01          SPOT.LCY.AMT             : 666,666.67          BUY.LCY.EQUIV            :-666,666.67          SEL.LCY.EQUIV            : 666,666.67

		/* Contains the local currency equivalent of the currency being sold.  The field will be calculated by the system and no operator input will be allowed.
This local currency equivalent will be used when updating the currency position after successful validation.
When Foreign Exchange deals are first entered into the foreign currency position, the local currency equivalent for both the BUY.LCY.EQUIV and SEL.LCY.EQUIV depends on the revaluation method specified in the corresponding contract.  The following rules will be adhered to for each one of the revaluation methods below.

REBATE METHOD
The following rules will be followed:
a) When the contract involves local currency
It is always the local currency amount [AMOUNT.BOUGHT or       AMOUNT.SOLD] which will be used to generate the local currency       value in BOTH fields BUY.LCY.EQUIV and SEL.LCY.EQUIV.
b) When the contract does not involve local currency
The BASE amount of the contract will be converted at contract       FORWARD.RATE and the forward rate of the other currency (non base       currency) to generate the local currency value in BOTH fields       BUY.LCY.EQUIV and SEL.LCY.EQUIV.
If for example:
SPOT   GBP/DEM           = 3,30       SPOT   GBP/USD           = 1,50       FWD 3 MONTH GBP/USD      = 1,48       FWD 3 MONTH GBP/DEM      = 3,24
the following local currency equivalents will be calculated by the       system for the next deals:
Deal 1       ------       Currency & Amount Bought : USD 1,000,000.00       Rate of Exchange         : 1.48       (Spot Rate)              :(1.50)       Currency & Amount Sold   : GBP 675,675.68       Value Date               : 6 Months       Dealer Desk              : 01       Revaluation Type         : RB       SPOT.LCY.AMT             : 666,666.67       BUY.LCY.EQUIV            :-675,675.68       SEL.LCY.EQUIV            : 675,675.68

STRAIGHT LINE METHOD
The following rules will be followed:
a) When the contract involves local currency
- The local currency amount of the contract will be kept to         generate the local currency value in its corresponding         BUY.LCY.EQUIV or SEL.LCY.EQUIV, i.e:
if AMOUNT.BOUGHT  =  Local currency, then            AMOUNT.BOUGHT  =  BUY.LCY.EQUIV
if   AMOUNT.SOLD  =  Local currency, then              AMOUNT.SOLD  =  SEL.LCY.EQUIV
- The foreign currency amount of the contract will be converted at         the contract SPOT.RATE to generate the local currency value in         its corresponding BUY.LCY.EQUIV or SEL.LCY.EQUIV.
b) When the contract does not involve local currency
- The BASE amount of the contract will be converted at the CURRENCY         table middle rate of the BASE currency to generate the local Y.EQUIV.
- The other foreign currency amount of the contract will be         converted at the contract SPOT.RATE and the CURRENCY table middle         rate of the BASE currency to generate the local currency value in         its corresponding BUY.LCY.EQUIV or SEL.LCY.EQUIV.
If for example:
SPOT   GBP/DEM           = 3,30         SPOT   GBP/USD           = 1,50
the following local currency equivalents will be calculated by         the system for the next deals:

SPOT CONTRACTS
The following rules will be followed:
a) Where either the actual amount bought or amount sold happens to          be in the local currency of the country (Deal 1), this amount          will be adopted as the local currency equivalent for the other          currency so that the fields BUY.LCY.EQUIV and SEL.LCY.EQUIV on          the main Foreign Exchange contract will contain this same value.          It is also this local currency value which will be used to          update the Foreign Exchange position once the deal has been          successfully validated.
b) Where the local currency is neither the currency bought nor the          currency sold (Deal 2), the system will calculate the local          currency equivalent of the BASE currency/amount and apply it to          both currencies of the contract so that BUY.LCY.EQUIV and          SEL.LCY.EQUIV on the main Foreign Exchange contract will also          contain the same value.  To calculate this local currency          equivalent of the BASE amount, the system will take the existing          middle rate of the base currency as defined on the CURRENCY          table.  We have supposed here that on the CURRENCY table the          middle rate GBP/USD is equal to 1,50.  Like in the previous case          it is also this local currency equivalent which will be used to          update the Foreign Exchange position once the deal has been          successfully validated.
If for example:          SPOT   GBP/DEM           = 3,30          SPOT   GBP/USD           = 1,50
the following local currency equivalents will be calculated by          the system for the next deals:
Deal 1          ------          Currency & Amount Bought : USD 1,000,000.00          Rate of Exchange         : 1.5000          Currency & Amount Sold   : GBP 666,666.67          Value Date               : SPOT          Dealer Desk              : 01          SPOT.LCY.AMT             : 666,666.67          BUY.LCY.EQUIV            :-666,666.67          SEL.LCY.EQUIV            : 666,666.67

		/* Contains the daily local currency amount which is to be accrued on those 'Swap' or 'Forward' contracts where the revaluation type 'SL', 'IN' or 'IH' has been specified.
In the case of Forward or Swap contracts done under the Straight Line revaluation method, the amount, which will be generated automatically by the system in this field, will be calculated based on the apparent exchange PROFIT generated by the forward nature of the transaction.  This apparent exchange PROFIT expressed in local currency (i.e. the difference between BUY.LCY.EQUIV and SELL.LCY.EQUIV) will be spread over the period of the contract to provide a per dium accrual amount in local currency.
In the case of Forward or Swap contracts done under the Interest revaluation method, the amount, which will be generated automatically by the system in this field, will be calculated based on the INT.RATE.BUY, i.e. the daily interest amount (expressed in local currency) generated by the AMOUNT.BOUGHT at the INT.RATE.BUY.
In the case of Forward contracts done under the Interest/hedged revaluation method, the amount, which will be generated automatically by the system in this field, will be calculated based on the INT.RATE.BUY, i.e. the daily interest amount (expressed in local currency) generated by the NOTIONAL.BUY.AMT at the INT.RATE.BUY.
Under the straight-line and interest methods of revaluation, this figure will normally be exactly the local equivalent amount at which each day's interest accrual is booked.  It is, however, subject to an adjustment (on a rolling basis) to ensure that the entire net interest amount booked over the period of the accruals matches exactly the difference in BUY.LCY.EQUIV and SEL.LCY.EQUIV.
Under the interest/hedged method of revaluation, the figure is for information purposes only.  The accruals will actually be booked in foreign currency against a local equivalent at the prevailing spot rate.
Examples:
1. Straight Line revaluation method
Let us suppose a Forward transaction whereby:
6 MTH FWD we buy IM USD against 2,150,000 DEM            (the Spot rate being 2.20).
The apparent profit, i.e. DEM 50,000.00 will be accrued daily       during the 6 month period (185 days in our example) and will       generate a daily accrual of DEM 50,000.00 : 185 = DEM 270.27 which,       converted at the rate of 3.30, produces a daily accrual in local       currency of GBP (local currency) 81.90.  This amount will then be       recorded in this field.

2. Interest revaluation method
Let us suppose a Forward transaction whereby:
6MTH FWD we buy IM USD against 2,150,000 DEM.            The spot rate is equal to 2.20            The INT.RATE.BUY is equal to 12%            The INT.RATE.SELL is equal to 7,5773%
The system will then calculate the daily interest amount on the       amount bought, i.e.
1,000,000.00  x  12 x 1            -----------------------   = USD 333.33                      3600
which, converted at the rate of 1.50, produces a daily accrual in       local currency of GBP (local currency) 222.22.  This amount will       then be recorded in this field.

3.  Interest/hedged revaluation method
Let us suppose a Forward transaction whereby:
6MTH FWD we buy IM USD against 2,150,000 DEM.            The spot rate is equal to 2.20            The INT.RATE.BUY is equal to 12%            The INT.RATE.SELL is equal to 7,1441%
The system will then calculate the daily interest amount on the       notional principal underlying the amount bought, i.e.
943,835.33 x 12 x 1            ------------------- = 310.30                   3600
which, converted at the rate of 1.50, produces a daily accrual in       local currency of GBP (local currency) 206.87.  This amount will       then be recorded in this field.
Notes:       -----       1. Under the Straight Line revaluation Method, this field will only          be activated when the exchange contract has been done with a          profit, i.e. the SELL.LCY.EQUIV is smaller (in absolute value)          than the BUY.LCY.EQUIV.
2. Under the Interest revaluation method, the difference between          the value generated in this field and the value generated in          the field SEL.DAILY.ACC.L will correspond exactly to the daily          accrual generated under the Straight Line revaluation method.

Under the interest/hedged method of revaluation, the figure is the total of the local equivalents of accruals which have been booked to date in foreign currency. The local equivalent value of each of these daily accruals is calculated on the basis of the prevailing spot rate at the time.
Examples:
1. Straight Line revaluation method
Let us suppose a Forward transaction whereby:
6MTH FWD we buy IM USD against 2,150,000 DEM            (the Spot rate being 2.20)
The apparent profit, i.e. DEM 50,000.00 will be accrued daily       during the 6 month period (185 days in our example) and will       generate a daily accrual of DEM 50,000.00 : 185 = DEM 270.27 which,       converted at 3.30, produces a daily accrual in local currency of       GBP (local currency) 81.90.       Consequently, the value of this field will be GBP 81.90 after the       first day, then GBP 163.80 etc. to GBP 15,151.51 (i.e. DEM       50,000.00) on the maturity date.

2.  Interest revaluation method

The system will then calculate the daily interest amount on the       amount bought, i.e.
1,000,000.00  x  12 x 1            -----------------------  = USD 333.33                   36000
which, converted at the rate of 1.50, produces a daily accrual in       local currency of GBP (local currency) 222.22.  Consequently the       value of this field will be GBP 222.22 after the first day, then       GBP 444.44 etc. to GBP 41,111.11 on the maturity date.

		/* Contains the foreign currency amount of the profit or loss accrued to-date on the 'Swap' or 'Forward' contract where the revaluation type 'IN' or 'IH' has been specified.  This field will be increased daily by the amount specified in the daily accrual foreign currency table.
In the case of Forward or Swap contracts done under the Interest revaluation method, the amount, which will be generated automatically by the system in this field, will be calculated based on the INT.RATE.SELL, i.e. the daily interest amount (expressed in foreign currency) generated by the AMOUNT.SOLD at the INT.RATE.SELL.  This field will then be incremented each day by the value of the daily (foreign currency) amount.
In the case of Forward contracts done under the interest/hedged revaluation method, the amount, which will be generated automatically by the system in this field, will be calculated based on the INT.RATE.SELL, i.e. the daily interest amount (expressed in foreign currency) generated by the NOTIONAL.SELL.AMT at the INT.RATE.SELL.  This field will then be incremented each day by the value of the daily (foreign currency) amount.
Example:
Let us suppose a Forward transaction whereby:
6MTH FWD we buy IM USD against 2,150,000 DEM.            The spot rate is equal to 2.20            The INT.RATE.BUY is equal to 12%            The INT.RATE.SELL is equal to 7,5773%
The system will then calculate the daily interest amount on the amount sold, i.e.
2,150,000.00  x  75773 x 1            -------------------------- = DEM 452.54                        36000
which, converted at the rate of 3.2250, produces a daily accrual in local currency of GBP (local currency) 140.32.  Consequently the value of this field will be DEM 452.54 after the first day, then DEM 905.08 etc. to DEM 83,719.90 on the maturity date.

1. Under the Straight Line revaluation Method, this field will not           be activated.

- When the contract does not involve the local currency, the             BASE currency accrual amount will be converted at the CURRENCY             table middle rate and the non-base accrual amount at the             contract FORWARD.RATE and the CURRENCY table middle rate of             the BASE currency.

		/* This is an internal field which is automatically generated by the system when the CPARTY has a SWIFT address defined on the Agency file.  This common reference will be used on all messages transmitted through SWIFT.
The common reference consists of the SWIFT confirmation address codes of the two counterparties, i.e. ourselves and the CPARTY of the transaction. These codes will appear in alphabetical order.  From the CPARTY SWIFT confirmation address specified in the Agency file, the system will automatically select the first four digits plus the seventh and eighth digit.
The two codes are separated by four figures from the exchange rate on the contract as agreed by the two counterparties.  The exchange rate itself is expressed in the following form:

This field is only used when the interest, interest/hedged or straight line funding revaluation method has been selected for a forward contract (REVALUATION.TYPE is 'IN', 'IH' or 'SF').
The value which the system places in this field represents the interest element which will be accrued to profit & loss over the lifetime of the deal.
In the case of the straight line funding method (REVALUATION.TYPE is 'SF'), this amount is the premium or discount of the Swap in the non Swap Base Currency, i.e. the bought currency. It is a premium when the amount is greater than zero; otherwise, it is a discount.
In the case of interest method revaluation (REVALUATION.TYPE is 'IN'), this is the amount which would be yielded by the contract amount (AMOUNT.BOUGHT), at the given interest rate (INT.RATE.BUY) over the lifetime of the deal.
In the case of interest/hedged method revaluation (REVALUATION.TYPE is 'IH'), it is the amount which would be yielded by the notional principal amount (NOTIONAL.BUY.AMT), at the given interest rate (INT.RATE.BUY) over the lifetime of the deal.
In both cases, the interest accruals which are represented by fields BUY.DAILY.ACC.F & BUY.ACC.TDATE.F will, when the deal reaches maturity, add up to the figure shown in this field.
In the case of interest method revaluation, this foreign currency figure is for information purposes (the interest accruals being booked in local equivalent).
In the case of interest/hedged method revaluation, the interest accruals are accounted for in the currency of the deal (CURRENCY.BOUGHT).  The figure in this field therefore represents the foreign currency amount which will be booked across the exchange reserve account (interest received) over the lifetime of the contract.
Under the interest method, the value of TOTAL INT BOUGHT is calculated by the following formulae:
IA = A * ( IR / 100 ) * ( STV / IDB )
where:
IA = interest amount (bought)             A = amount (bought)            IR = interest rate (currency bought)           STV = spot-to-value number of days (currency bought)           IDB = interest day basis (currency bought)
Under the interest/hedged method, the value of TOTAL.INT.BOUGHT is calculated by subtraction of the notional principal amount (NOTIONAL.BUY.AMT) from the contract amount (AMOUNT.BOUGHT).  This calculation is equivalent to applying a similar formula to that shown above to the notional amount.

		/* The notional interest amount belonging to the contract amount sold. Revaluation methods 'IN', 'IH' and 'SF' only.
This field is only used when the interest, interest/hedged or straight line funding revaluation method has been selected for a forward contract (REVALUATION.TYPE is 'IN', 'IH' or 'SF').
The value which the system places in this field represents the interest element which will be accrued to profit & loss over the lifetime of the deal.
In the case of the straight line funding method (REVALUATION.TYPE is 'SF'), this amount is the premium or discount of the Swap in the non Swap Base Currency, i.e. the sold currency.  It is a discount when the amount is greater than zero; otherwise, it is a premium.
In the case of interest method revaluation (REVALUATION.TYPE, is 'IN'), this is the amount which would be yielded by the contract amount (AMOUNT.SOLD), at the given interest rate (INT.RATE.SELL) over the lifetime of the deal.
In the case of interest/hedged method revaluation (REVALUATION.TYPE is 'IH'), it is the amount which would be yielded by the notional principal amount (NOTIONAL.SELL.AMT), at the given interest rate (INT.RATE.SELL) over the lifetime of the deal.
In both cases, the interest accruals which are represented by fields SEL.DAILY.ACC.F & SEL.ACC.TDATE.F will, when the deal reaches maturity, add up to the figure shown in this field.
In the case of interest method revaluation, this foreign currency figure is for information purposes (the interest accruals being booked in local equivalent).
In the case of interest/hedged method revaluation, the interest accruals are accounted for in the currency of the deal (CURRENCY.SOLD).  The figure in this field therefore represents the foreign currency amount which will be booked across the exchange reserve account (interest paid) over the lifetime of the contract.
Under the interest method, the value of TOTAL.INT.SOLD is calculated by the following formulae:
IA = A * ( IR / 100 ) * ( STV / IDB )
where:
IA = interest amount (sold)             A = amount (sold)            IR = interest rate (currency sold)           STV = spot-to-value number of days (currency sold)           IDB = interest day basis (currency sold)
Under the interest/hedged method, the value of TOTAL.INT.SOLD is calculated by subtraction of the notional principal amount (NOTIONAL.SELL.AMT) from the contract amount (AMOUNT.SOLD).  This calculation is equivalent to applying a similar formula to that shown above to the notional amount.

Input to this field for internal accounts must be entered in the          format 1 to give the first account: 2 to give the second and so          forth as detailed on the FX.TEXT table.
An input of a customer account which does not pertain to the          counterparty will request an override except if the account is a          Nostro account.  (Since in an option forward contract there may          be several delivery dates, the override message prompted to the          user will indicate for which delivery set (D.S.#) the override is          required.)
In case the underlying Contract Customer (eg.

		/* This field is used when the counterparty of the deal instructs us to pay funds to another party who does not have an account with us.
When a contract matures, funds must be moved to actually settle the contract. This involves paying the counterparty or his nominated beneficiary for the currency sold and receiving funds for the currency purchased.  The counterparty will advise us of where the money which we have sold is to be paid and we will advise them where we require the currency purchased to be remitted.  The delivery of funds will normally be as one payment but may be in several instalments.
Entry in this field will be accepted where the beneficiary is known to the bank (i.e. there is a customer record for the beneficiary). If the beneficiary is not known to us, the beneficiary details may be entered in the Beneficiary address field.
Note that, where the beneficiary requests the funds into an account he has with us, this should be specified in the Our Account Pay field.
It is important to note that when the Beneficiary is specified, the Counterparty Correspondent field will be used to indicate the bank of the beneficiary.
The counterparty may ask us to pay the amount sold in a number of ways:
To an account with us
We may pay the funds directly into an account provided it is in the same currency as that being sold.  To make payment directly to a counterparty's internal account the relevant account number should be entered in the Our Account Pay field and no other input will be necessary in this field.

To an account at another bank overseas
To pay money to another bank overseas we would have to advise our agent, in the country concerned, to pay to the counterparty's bank. In this case, the Nostro account number of our agent should be entered in the Our Account Pay field. If the counterparty's bank is known to us (i.e. there is a customer record), then the bank's number should be entered in CPARTY.CORR.NO if these details have not yet been defined on the Agency file. If the bank is not known to us, (i.e. there is no customer record) the bank's name and address should be entered in the multi-valued field CPARTY.CORR.ADD.  When known, the counterparty's account number at his bank should be entered in the field CPARTY.BANK.ACC.

To an account at another bank locally
Where payment is to be effected locally, settlement can be through a number of different methods. The most common are Banker's Payments, CHIPS, or CHAPS. In all cases, the number of our internal clearing account, or our clearing agent should be entered in OUR.ACCOUNT.PAY.  Details of the counterparty's bank account should be completed as detailed above.

To a beneficiary of the counterparty
The counterparty may nominate a third party beneficiary of the funds. If the beneficiary is to be paid by crediting an account with us, the account number should be entered in OUR.ACCOUNT.PAY.  If the beneficiary does not have an account with us, the internal clearing number or Nostro account of our agent should be entered in OUR.ACCOUNT.PAY.

Payment via an intermediary bank
Occasionally the counterparty may ask for payment to be made through an intermediary bank.  This occurs where the counterparty or beneficiary's correspondent is not in the country of the currency involved.  As an example, let us say that the BANK 'ABC' in Hong Kong uses BANK 'XYZ' in Hong Kong as their dollar agent.  When a dollar payment is to be made we would pay American Bank in New York (the Intermediary) for Bank XYZ in HK (the Cparty correspondent), account Bank ABC (the Cparty or Beneficiary).

		/* This field is used when the counterparty of the deal instructs us to pay funds to another party who does not have an account with us.
When a contract matures, funds must be moved to actually settle the contract. This involves paying the counterparty or his nominated beneficiary for the currency sold and receiving funds for the currency purchased.  The counterparty will advise us of where the money which we have sold is to be paid and we will advise them where we require the currency purchased to be remitted.  The delivery of funds will normally be as one payment but may be in several instalments.
If the beneficiary is known to us (i.e. there is a customer record), the beneficiary details should be entered in the BENEFICIARY.NO field. If unknown to us, details should be entered in this multi-value field.  Note that, where the beneficiary requests the funds into an account he has with us, this should be specified in the OUR.ACCOUNT.PAY field.
It is important to note that when the Beneficiary is specified, the Counterparty Correspondent field will be used to indicate the bank of the beneficiary.
The counterparty may ask us to pay the amount sold in a number of ways:

To an account with us
We may pay the funds directly into an account provided it is in the same currency as that being sold.  To make payment directly to a counterparty's internal account the relevant account number should be entered in the OUR.ACCOUNT.PAY field and no other input will be necessary in this field.

To an account at another bank overseas
To pay money to another bank overseas we would have to advise our agent, in the country concerned, to pay to the counterparty's bank.  In this case, the Nostro account number of our agent should be entered in the OUR.ACCOUNT.PAY field.  If the counterparty's bank is known to us (i.e. there is a customer record), then the bank's number should be entered in CPARTY.CORR.NO if these details have not yet been defined on the Agency file.  If the bank is not known to us, (i.e. there is no customer record) the bank's name and address should be entered in the multi-valued field CPARTY.CORR.ADD.  When known, the counterparty's account number at his bank should be entered in the field CPARTY.BANK.ACC.

To an account at another bank locally
Where payment is to be effected locally, settlement can be through a number of different methods.  The most common are Banker's Payments, CHIPS, or CHAPS. In all cases, the number of our internal clearing account, or our clearing agent should be entered in OUR.ACCOUNT.PAY. Details of the counterparty's bank account should be completed as detailed above.

To a beneficiary of the counterparty
The counterparty may nominate a third party beneficiary of the funds.  If the beneficiary is to be paid by crediting an account with us, the account number should be entered in OUR.ACCOUNT.PAY.  If the beneficiary does not have an account with us, the internal clearing number or Nostro account of our agent should be entered in OUR.ACCOUNT.PAY.
Where we are paying to another bank but the beneficiary is known to us (i.e. there is a customer record), the customer number of the beneficiary will be entered in the field BENEFICIARY.NO.  Where no relationship exists, the payment details will be entered in the multi-valued field BENFCY.ADD.

Payment via an intermediary bank
Occasionally the counterparty may ask for payment to be made through an intermediary bank.  This occurs where the counterparty or beneficiary's correspondent is not in the country of the currency involved. As an example, let us say that the Bank 'ABC' in Hong Kong uses Bank 'XYZ' in Hong Kong as their dollar agent. When a dollar payment is to be made we would pay American Bank in New York (the Intermediary) for Bank 'XYZ in HK (the Cparty correspondent), account Bank 'ABC' (the Cparty or Beneficiary).  The Intermediary can be entered as a number in the INTERMED.BK.NO field if a customer relationship exists (i.e. there is a customer number) or as narrative in the Intermed Add field.

		/* A number generated automatically by the system which identifies either a statement entry or a category entry in respect of a contract.
The system will automatically insert a number into this field and this number may refer to a statement entry or a category entry depending on the value contained in the corresponding multivalue fields.  The following examples will illustrate the use of this field.
Example 1:
On the value date of a Foreign Exchange contract there will be an entry on the our account pay and the following type of number will be generated at this field:
154.1  STMT.NO ............ 673732684.48            154.2  STMT.NO ............ 1
The number automatically generated in Field 104.1 is unique to the contract in question and is built in the following way:
1. The first four digits '6737' indicate the number of days since the 1st    of January 1968.  In our example, it corresponds to the 11th of June    1986.
2. The next five digits '32684' indicate the number of seconds since    midnight.  In our example, it corresponds to an entry generated on line    at 09:04:44 AM.
3. The last two digits '48' indicate the number of hundreds of seconds.
The value assigned (again automatically) to field 154.2 identifies the number in 154.1 as a statement entry number.  If the user wishes to call this statement entry record on to the screen the user will invoke the STMT.ENTRY Application and then type the following at 'AWAITING ID':
673732684.480001
where the suffix '0001' identifies it as the first statement entry (there may be more than one as the next example will illustrate).
Example 2:
A second example outlined here is similar to example 1 in that there is a statement entry on value date for both the OUR.ACCOUNT.PAY and the OUR.ACCOUNT.RECEIVE.  The system handles this case as follows:
154.1  STMT.NO ............ 673732684.48            154.2  STMT.NO ............ 1-2
Once again field 154.1 contains the identification number automatically generated by the system while field 154.2 now contains two separate numbers signifying that there are in fact two separate statement entries, one in respect of the OUR.ACCOUNT.PAY and one in respect of the OUR.ACCOUNT.RECEIVE.  If the user wishes to see either of these he must first of all invoke STMT.ENTRY followed by the desired function and then at 'AWAITING ID' type either:
673732684.480001
where the addition of the suffix '0001' identifies the statement entry in respect of the OUR ACCOUNT PAY or
673732684.480002
where the addition of the suffix '0002' identifies the statement entry in respect of the OUR ACCOUNT RECEIVE.
Example 3:
A third example might be that of a category entry generated at initiation of a contract where commission or charges have been debited to the customer and credited to a profit and loss category code.  In this case the following entries are generated on the contract:
154.1  STMT.NO ............ 673732684.48            154.3  STMT.NO ............ 1
Once again the standard type number is generated and inserted at field 154.1
Now, however, field 154.2 is replaced by Field 104.3 which now identifies the number in 154.1 as a category entry and not a statement entry.
To call this category entry record onto the screen the user must now type:
CATEG.ENTRY at 'AWAITING APPLICATION'
followed by:
673732684.480001 at 'AWAITING ID'.

		/* Contains all the Override messages which the user agreed to during Input.
During the validation stage of a Foreign Exchange contract, the system may provide the user with a series of screen override messages to indicate an anomaly, for instance, that the exchange rate varies by more than the variation tolerance defined in the CURRENCY table.
In the event that the user confirms the Override, the full text of the actual Override Message will be stored, for reference purposes only, in this multivalue field.
For example, if the user inserts an 'abnormal' exchange rate the field corresponding to the exchange rate then when the deal is validated a warning bell will sound and a message will appear, at the foot of the screen, which reads:
'VARIANCE OF RATE EXCEEDS PERMITTED TOLERANCE'
This will draw the user's attention to the rate entered, which may be a mistake and can then be corrected, or, on the other hand, it may be correct input and so the user confirms that this rate is really intended.
A second example might be in respect of a contract done with a client who has a credit line established with the bank but where the maturity date of the intended Foreign Exchange contract goes beyond the credit line expiry date.  In this case when the deal is validated a warning bell will sound and a message will appear, at the foot of the screen, which reads:
'LINE EXPIRES BEFORE TXN MATURITY'
Once again the user's attention is drawn to the situation and either corrected or confirmed via a positive response to the Override Message.
If, subsequently, the contract record is either fully displayed or printed, then all override messages will be present.
