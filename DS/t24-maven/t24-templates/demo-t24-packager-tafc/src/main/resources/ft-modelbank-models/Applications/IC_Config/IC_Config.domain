	/* ACCOUNT.ACCRUAL


The purpose of the Account Accrual table is to provide the system with information at Company level about how and when to process Accruals of interest and charges on Customer Accounts and whether interest capitalisation is inclusive or exclusive of the balance on capitalisation date, the value dates of interest entries generated and the day on which the entries are booked.
Interest Accruals may be processed daily or monthly. or it could be specified that no accrual is to be made. Account charges may only be processed at calendar month end.
The periodicity of interest accrual could be specified at  Account Group or Category Level for different  Currency types (foreign or local). For  Accounts not covered by  specified definition,  default interest accrual periodicity could be defined based  on Account Currency type.
Dates for interest capitalisation are specified at group level in the Group Capitalisation table and for specific Accounts in the Account Capitalisation table. */

Field 2 - the start date of the calculation period, this can be adjusted if required
Field 3 - The end date of the calculation period, this is for information only
Field 4 - Indicates the type of processing taking palce, and is information only, "S" = capitalisation, "A" = accrual, "C" = back value correction, "I" = information only, no accounting entries are posted nb: this can be used via the INFO.ACCT.XX routines for testing purposes where XX indicates the type of interest calculation DR,DR2, CR, CR2, CH
Field 5 - the current list of compensation accounts delimited by value marks marks, this can be adjusted by the local routine
Field6 - associated with field5 this can be returned from the local routine and can contain the start date when the balances for the relevant compensation account in field5 are included in the compensation group balances
Field7 - associated with field5 this can be returned from the local routine and can contain the end date when the balances for the relevant compensation account in field5 are excluded from the compensation group balances
An example follows of how this local routien could be used to adjust the calculation of the compensation group balances.
Acount 100002 was compensated to account 10001 from the second of the month to the tenth of the month.
The calcuation period is the 1st to the 31st of the month.
Account 100002 has a balance of 1000 for the whole period.
Account 100001 has a balance of 2000 for the whole period.
The calculation takes place on the 2nd of the month and is projected to the end of the month.
Normally the compensation group balance will be 3000 for the whole month.
However if the local routine is called the compensation balances can be calculated as follows
1st  2000
2nd  3000
10th 2000
nb: the above example will require a local development to store the start and end dates of the compensation group memberships. */

	/* This table is used to specify for groups of Accounts which charges are to be levied and what balance overrides are allowed.  The GENERAL.CHARGE record applicable to a particular Account is specified in the relevant Group or Account Debit Interest Record.
Charges fall into 2 types, those that are levied at the same time as debit interest is applied (Interest Related Charges) and those which are considered to be fees for maintenance of an Account (Ledger Fee Charges).
If the Account has maintained a higher balance than that specified, calculated charges can be waived.  Separate sets of balance level details are specified for Interest Related Charges and for Ledger Fee Charges.

Interest Related Charges
Interest Related Charges include DEBIT.INT.ADDON, GOVERNMENT.MARGIN, HIGHEST.DEBIT Charge and INTEREST.STATEMENT Charge.  DEBIT.INT.ADDON, GOVERNMENT.MARGIN and HIGHEST.DEBIT are charged when debit one interest is applied.  Either DEBIT.INT.ADDON or HIGHEST.DEBIT may be charged but not both.  INTEREST.STATEMENT Charge is levied each time debit one interest is applied.
In each case the rates applicable are those ruling on the date of debit one interest capitalisation.

Ledger Fee Charges
Ledger Fee Charges may be applied monthly, quarterly or half yearly as specified in the Company record, always at the end of a calendar month.
The charges can be based on Balance Requirement, Number of Credits, Number of Debits, Turnover of Credits, Turnover of Debits and non immediate Transaction charges depending on the Transaction Codes.  Either the number of credits and debits or the turnover figures can be charged, but not both.  It is possible to combine all these charges into one charge.  A notional amount of credit interest may be calculated and deducted from the charge amount.
In each case the charges effective on the date of the charges capitalisation are applicable for the whold of the capitalisation period.
A waive marker may be set in Account records to indicate that charges should be calculated but not applied.
No Ledger Fee Charges are calculated on balances and activity in the month in which an Account is opened or closed, (unless the Account Closure date is the last day of the month). */

	/* Transaction charges can be either set up to be calculated when a transaction is booked (CHARGE.PERIOD is set to "T") or when charges
are capitalised (CHARGE.PERIOD is blank).
The amount per entry, Free Amount, Minimum Amount and Maximum Amount may be defined for specified Currencies. Default Amounts in local currency equivalent are used for accounts in currencies for which no amounts are specified.
All Account Maintenance Charges are applied on the charge capitalisation date as specified in CHARGE.CALCULATION on the COMPANY record, (monthly, quarterly, six monthly or annually).

For "T" type charges the parameter records (TRANSACTION, GENERAL.CHARGE and TRANSACTION.CHARGE) relevant to the time of booking will be used. If a parameter record is changed previously booked charges will not be affected. However the REBUILD.TRAN.CHARGES table can be used to trigger a rebuild of transaction charges using the parameter records relevant to the rebuild date.

If transaction charges are set to be calculated at the charge capitalisation date then the parameter records relevant to the charge capitalisation date will apply to all relevant transactions booked during the charge capitalisation period.

For transaction charges to apply to a customer account then 2 conditions must occur:
The account must be linked to a GENERAL.CHARGE record set for transaction charges.
TRANSACTION record(s) must set up for transaction charges.

The GENERAL.CHARGE table is linked to an account via GROUP.DEBIT.INT or ACCOUNT.DEBIT.INT and is set up for transaction charges as follows:
TRANS.CODE.CHARGE set to "Y" indicates that transaction charges are to be applied for this general charge type.
COMB.TRNS.CDE Indicates the transaction charge record used to apply  free, minimum and maximum amounts against transaction charge totals. The PL category for charge postings will be picked up from the relevant TRANSACTION.CHARGE record defined here. The PL categories for individual transaction code totals will be blanked on the STMT.ACCT.CH record.
CHARGE.CODE.LEVEL determines whether all charges are combined or the free minimum and maximum amounts are applied to each major charge type. Setting this to "IND" will apply the free minimum and maximum amounts to the transaction charge total. Setting it to "COM" indicates that Transaction Charges should be combined into one entry with other account maintenance charges, which can include; BALANCE.REQUIREMENT, NUMBER.OF.CREDITS or TURNOVER.CREDIT NUMBER.OF.DEBITS or TURNOVER.DEBIT.

The TRANSACTION table is linked to transaction charges as follows:
IMMEDIATE.CHARGE has to be set to NO to activate transaction charges.
CHARGE.KEY links to TRANSACTION.CHARGE via TRANSACTION.CHARGE.XREF
for example;
1 - would link to TRANSACTION.CHARGE record 1 “.” effective date via TRANSACTION.CHARGE.XREF
1.2 would link to a TRANSACTION CHARGE record 1 “.” Effective date “.” 2 (where 2 relates to a specific general charge record).

The TRANSACTION.CHARGE.XREF table stores the effective dates relating to TRANSACTION.CHARGE records
The key contains the sequence number and an optional GENERAL.CHARGE key
The record contains the effective dates for the charges.

If the GENERAL.CHARGE relevant to the customer account and TRANSACTION relevant to the transaction code in an accounting entry are both set up for transaction charges the relevant TRANSACTION.CHARGE record will be determined and if it has the CHARGE.PERIOD set to "T" the transaction charge will be calculated when a transaction is booked. ACCR.ACCT.TRAN.CH will be updated with the charge data. The mimimum maximum and free amounts will not apply to individual charges calculated when a transaction is booked. It is possible to set more than one transaction charge per transaction.

Examples:
In all cases where records have effective dates in the key the record selected will be the one with the date closest to but not greater than the charge calculation date.

GENERAL.CHARGE 1 and 3 set for transaction charges 2 is not
TRANS.CODE.CHARGE = "Y"

TRANSACTION 213 set up for transaction charges as follows
IMMEDIATE.CHARGE = "NO"
CHARGE.KEY set to 1.2 1.3 1

ACCOUNTS
12345 linked to GENERAL.CHARGE type 3.
23456 linked to GENERAL.CHARGE type 5.
45678 linked to GENERAL.CHARGE type 2.

An entry is booked to each account with a transaction code of 213.
The relevant TRANSACTION.CHARGE records will be as follows
12345 - 1.YYYYMMDD.3
23456 - 1.YYYYMMDD
45678 - no charges apply

Using the above example but TRANSACTION 213 has CHARGE.KEY set to 1.2 1.3 1 2
2 charges will apply to the transaction from the TRANSACTION.CHARGE records
12345 - 1.YYYYMMDD.3 and 2.YYYYMMDD
23456 - 1.YYYYMMDD   and 2.YYYYMMDD
45678 - no charges apply */
