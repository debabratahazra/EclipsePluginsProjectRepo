Interest is accrued at every monthend (on the day specified in the MTH.END.UPTO.DAY field in the ACCOUNT.ACCRUAL table) and whenever it is capitalised.
ACCR.ACCT.CR2 records contain details of credit 2 interest which has been accrued but not yet capitalised (booked to the Customer's Account). At each monthend the interest accrued since the last capitalisation is recalculated, the appropriate Profit and Loss entries are generated and a new ACCR.ACCT.CR2 record is written, replacing the one generated the previous month. When the interest is capitalised, a STMT.ACCT.CR2 record is written and the ACCR.ACCT.CR2 record is deleted.
Credit 2 Interest is calculated according to rules specified in the fields with prefix CR2 in the appropriate ACCOUNT.CREDIT.INT record or GROUP.CREDIT.INT record. It may be Capitalised, i.e. booked to the Customer's Account, on the same dates as normal Credit Interest, or on different dates.)
Interest is calculated on the value dated balances stored in the ACCT.ACTIVITY file, taking into account all entries over the Account up to and including the day of processing.
The first balance included in the calculation is the day after the last Credit 2 Interest Capitalisation, as stored in the ACCOUNT record (in the CAP.DATE.C2.INT field).
The last balance included is the one with Value Date equal to the month end date specified in the MTH.END.UPTO.DAY in the ACCOUNT.ACCRUAL record. The month end accrual calculations are always inclusive of the balance on the month end day. */

ACCR.ACCT.DR records contain details of debit interest and interest related charges which have been accrued but not yet capitalised (booked to the Customer's Account).

Interest and interest related charges are calculated on the value dated balances stored in the ACCT.ACTIVITY file, taking into account all entries over the Account up to and including the day of processing.
The first balance included in the calculation is the day after the last Debit Interest Capitalisation, as stored in the ACCOUNT record (in the CAP.DATE.DR.INT field).

It should be noted that an ACCT.CAPITALISATION record should only be set up when interest is to be applied on different dates from those specified in the associated GROUP.CAPITALISATION record.
Interest may be applied any day of the month.  Cycles may be different for debit and credit interest, (e.g. debit interest may be charged monthly and credit interest paid quarterly) unless credit interest is only to be calculated as an offset to debit interest.
The date of debit interest application is also used as the date of application of Interest Related Charges.  (These are DEBIT.INT.ADDON, GOVERNMENT.MARGIN, HIGHEST.DEBIT and INTEREST.STATEMENT charges.)
If the 'Last Day Inclusive' field in the Account Accrual file contains 'Y', interest is calculated on balances with value up to and including the capitalisation date. The value date of the interest entry booked is the day after the capitalisation date.
If 'Last Day Inclusive' contains 'NO' only balances up to and including the previous working day are included.  The value date of the interest entry booked is the day after the last balance included.
Interest entries are booked to the Customer Account on the day they are calculated, or on the next working day, depending on the Application Posting Day specified in the ACCOUNT.ACCRUAL record.
If the capitalisation date falls on a non-working day, the application is processed on the previous working day, unless 'Last Day Inclusive' contains 'Y' and a month end accrual day falls before the capitalisation date, in which case the application is processed on the next working day. In either case, the calculation is up to the capitalisation date and the entries generated have the same value date as they would have had if they had been processed on that date. */

This will be for what is normally called a split month end.
For example if the end of the month is  Friday 31st and the first working day of the next month is Monday the 3rd, then any accounts set for capitalisation on the first or second of the month will be capitalised in the start of day processing of the COB starting on Friday 31st. If the account is not set for start of day capitalisation then the accounts due for capitalisation on the first or second will be capitalised during the EOD processing of the COB starting on Monday 3rd.
In a situation where the next working day is 1 day after the period end of the EOD portion of the COB accounts will be capitalised during the EOD processing of the COB running on the capitalisation date even if the account is set for start of day capitalisation. For example COB begins on Friday 15th, Period end is Sunday 17th, next working day is Monday 18th, then accounts set for start of day capitalisation and with a capitalisation date of the 18th will be capitalised in the EOD processing of the COB starting on the 18th.

Interest may be applied any day of the month. Cycles may be different for debit and credit interest, (e.g. debit interest may be charged monthly and credit interest paid quarterly) unless credit interest is only to be calculated as an offset to debit interest.
The date of debit interest application is also used as the date of application of Interest Related Charges. (These are Debit Interest Addon, Government Margin, Highest Debit and Interest Statement charges.)
If the 'Last Day Inclusive' field in the ACCOUNT.ACCRUAL file contains 'Y', interest is calculated on balances with value up to and including the capitalisation date. The value date of the interest entry booked is the day after the capitalisation date.
If 'Last Day Inclusive' contains 'NO' only balances up to and including the previous working day are included. The value date of the interest entry booked is the day after the last balance included.
Interest entries are booked to the Customer Account on the day they are calculated, or on the next working day, depending on the Application Posting Day specified in the ACCOUNT.ACCRUAL record. If the capitalisation date falls on a non-working day, the application is processed on the previous working day, unless 'Last Day Inclusive' contains 'Y' and a month end accrual day falls before the capitalisation date, in which case the application is processed on the next working day.

	/* The application INFO.ACCT.CH may be used to calculate account charges on-line up to a given date for a specific Account. Function 'V' is used to request the calculation.  Function 'S' allows the results of calculations to be viewed.
When the 'V' function is used - the id should be specified in the format Account number - Capital.date. In the 'S' function the account number can be specified to view the record.

Charges are calculated according to information contained in the COMPANY record.  This may specify that Charges are to be made Monthly, Quarterly or Half Yearly.  If Quarterly is specified, the Quarters begin on the 1st of January, April, July and October. If Half Yearly is specified, these begin on the 1st of January and July.
Charges are calculated on the value dated balances and account activity statistics stored in the ACCT.ACTIVITY file, taking into account all entries over the Account up to and including the last end of day processing.
The charges are calculated from the date of the last charges capitalisation, as stored in the ACCOUNT record (in the CAP DATE CHARGE field), up to the end of the month requested.
Notes : (1) The date up to which the calculation is requested must be             within the current charge period, i.e. not before the last             charge date or after the next charge date.
(2) When new Accounts are loaded, the last charge date (CAP DATE             CHARGE) is set to the end of the month in which they are             loaded. No charges are processed automatically in the first             month.
(3) No bookkeeping entries are generated by this application.  All             details contained in this file are for information only.
(4) The calculations do not take into account the effect of any             transactions which have not yet taken place but which are             expected to happen before the capitalisation date specified,             (e.g. Standing Orders or regular interest capitalisation), or             any transactions which have been processed since the last 'end             of day processing'. */

When the 'V' function is used - the id should be specified in the format Account number - Capital.date. In the 'S' function the account number can be specified to view the record.

(Debit 2 Interest is calculated according to rules specified in the fields with prefix DR2 in the appropriate ACCOUNT.DEBIT.INT record or GROUP.DEBIT.INT record. It may be Capitalised, i.e. booked to the Customer's Account, on the same dates as normal Debit Interest, or on different dates.)
Interest is calculated on the value dated balances stored in the ACCT.ACTIVITY file, taking into account all entries over the Account up to and including the last end of day processing.
The first balance included in the calculation is the day after the last debit interest capitalisation, as stored in the ACCOUNT record (in the CAP.DATE.DR.INT field).
The last balance included depends on the LAST.DAY.INCLUSIVE field in the ACCOUNT.ACCRUAL file, if this contains 'YES', balances are included up to the capitalisation date specified, if it contains 'NO', balances are included only up to the working day prior to the capitalisation date specified.
Notes :   (1) No bookkeeping entries are generated by this application.               All details contained in this file are for information only.
(2) The calculation does not take into account the effect of any               transactions which have not yet taken place but which are               expected to happen before the capitalisation date specified,               (e.g. Standing Orders or regular interest capitalisation,)               or any transactions which have been processed since the last               'end of day processing'. */

	/* This is an internal file containing details of the calculation of Credit 2 Interest for capitalisation (application to the Customer's Account). It is used to provide the details on interest statements and advices.
The dates and frequency for interest capitalisation are specified for groups of Accounts in the GROUP.CAPITALISATION table or, for specific Accounts, in the ACCT.CAPITALISATION table. The capitalisation is processed during the end of day processing for the capitalisation date specified, or, if this is a non-working day, on the previous working day (except, see note below).
Credit 2 Interest is calculated according to rules specified in the fields with prefix CR2 in the appropriate ACCOUNT.CREDIT.INT record or GROUP.CREDIT.INT record. It may be Capitalised, i.e. booked to the Customer's Account, on the same dates as normal Credit Interest, or on different dates.)
Interest is calculated on the value dated balances stored in the ACCT.ACTIVITY file, taking into account all entries over the Account up to and including the day of processing.
The first balance included in the calculation is the day after the last Credit 2 Interest Capitalisation, as stored in the ACCOUNT record (in the CAP DATE CR2 INT field).
The last balance included depends on the LAST DAY INCLUSIVE field in the ACCOUNT.ACCRUAL file, if this contains 'YES', balances are included up to and including the capitalisation date, if it contains 'NO', balances are included only up to the working day prior to the processing date. The date of the last balance included is written to the ACCOUNT record as the new CAP DATE CR2 INT.
Note:           If LAST DAY INCLUSIVE in the                 ACCOUNT.ACCRUAL file contains 'YES', and the                 Capitalisation date is on a non-working day,                 before the next working day, and the monthend                 accrual date also falls before the next working                 day and before the Capitalisation date, the                 capitalisation is processed on the NEXT working                 day. */

The dates and frequency for interest capitalisation are specified for groups of Accounts in the GROUP.CAPITALISATION table or, for specific Accounts, in the ACCT.CAPITALISATION table. The capitalisation is processed during the end of day processing for the capitalisation date specified, or, if this is a non-working day, on the previous working day (except, see note below).
Interest is calculated on the value dated balances stored in the ACCT.ACTIVITY file, taking into account all entries over the Account up to and including the day of processing.
The first balance included in the calculation is the day after the last Debit Interest Capitalisation, as stored in the ACCOUNT record (in the CAP DATE DR INT field).
The last balance included depends on the LAST DAY INCLUSIVE field in the ACCOUNT.ACCRUAL file, if this contains 'YES', balances are included up to and including the capitalisation date, if it contains 'NO', balances are included only up to the working day prior to the processing date. The date of the last balance included is written to the ACCOUNT record as the new CAP DATE DR INT.

The dates and frequency for interest capitalisation are specified for groups of Accounts in the GROUP.CAPITALISATION table or, for specific Accounts, in the ACCT.CAPITALISATION table. The capitalisation is processed during the end of day processing for the capitalisation date specified, or, if this is a non-working day, on the previous working day (except, see note below).
Debit 2 Interest is calculated according to rules specified in the fields with prefix DR2 in the appropriate ACCOUNT.DEBIT.INT record or GROUP.DEBIT.INT record. It may be Capitalised, i.e. booked to the Customer's Account, on the same dates as normal Debit Interest, or on different dates.)
Interest is calculated on the value dated balances stored in the ACCT.ACTIVITY file, taking into account all entries over the Account up to and including the day of processing.
The first balance included in the calculation is the day after the last Debit 2 Interest Capitalisation, as stored in the ACCOUNT record (in the CAP DATE DR2 INT field).
The last balance included depends on the LAST DAY INCLUSIVE field in the ACCOUNT.ACCRUAL file, if this contains 'YES', balances are included up to and including the capitalisation date, if it contains 'NO', balances are included only up to the working day prior to the processing date. The date of the last balance included is written to the ACCOUNT record as the new CAP DATE DR2 INT.
Note:      If LAST DAY INCLUSIVE in the ACCOUNT.ACCRUAL            file contains 'YES', and the Capitalisation date is on a            non-working day, before the next working day, and the            monthend accrual date also falls before the next working            day and before the Capitalisation date, the capitalisation            is processed on the NEXT working day. */

It allows the input of EB.ACCRUAL.PARAM keys so that the principal amounts and dates can be manipulated by the core accrual processing. EB.ACCRUAL.PARAM can be used to indicate the following: -
To include the start date of the contract in the acrual processing
Whether last day inclusive is used
How many days + or - to adjust the effective date of a principal increase or decrease.
It also allows the input of an EB.ROUNDING.RULE key to indicate how accrual amoutns are rounded.
It will display the prinicpal amounts and effective dates that are passed to EB.PERFORM.ACCRUAL, the core accrual processing routine, and will display the adjusted principal amounts and effective dates acutally used in the accrual processing.
It will also display the full results ot the accrual that has taken place, including the total accrual amounts. It is possible to simulate daily accrual by retaining the existing accrual data and incrementing the accrue to date value, and their is an option to clear the existing accrual data.

When this contract is verified the an array of principal amounts and pricipal change dates will be determined and the values used to populate the PRIN.IN.AMT and PRIN.IN.DATE fields. */
