		/* Customer number or Mnemonic.
It is common practice in some parts of the world, where a Collection document is directly sent by the customer to the Drawee or to the Drawee's banker and informs the same to Collecting Bank and hands over the copy of the collection document.
Although the Drawer' may quote a number of his choice, the same may not be possible with the Collecting Banker. To facilitate the process of nomenclature, the Collecting Banker allots a range of numbers to each customer and informs them of the same.
The Drawer quotes the same as reference number in his document and informs the Bank. This number is recorded in Collection type LC in the field DIRECT.COLL.NO.
Say, if DELL were to send a Collection Document for realization and a range allotted to them is COLL 1-100, a document may be registered as COLL24 and dispatched. This COLL24 is recorded by the Collecting Banker in the field DIRECT.COLL.NO and same is fetched when the LC is referred as  DELL.COLL24 or 50040.COLL24 (50024 being the Customer number) or the existing logic of referring as TF....

		/* Identifies the Currency for calculating the discount amount with each having a different flow.
Example:

Let us consider Discount party charged is Beneficiary.
Assume local currency is USD


INT.CALC.CCY     is LCCY, and CONV.RATE is BUY
Document amount of GBP 100,000 will be converted using the Buy rate, say 1.45 resulting in USD 145,000.

On this amount, Interest as defined will be calculated and the interest thus arrived would be (say Interest @7% for 100 days)  USD 2,780.82


This will be converted to GBP (again at BUY rate) for raising consol entry, 2780.82/1.45 = GBP 1,917.81Say the Customer has contracted the Drawing at 1.46.
The payment would be for USD 146,000 - 2,780.82 = 143,219.18




INT.CALC.CCY     is DRAW.CCY, and CONV.RATE is SELL,
Assume the GBP interest rate is 5% and the bill period as 100 days.
In this instance, the interest amount will be GBP 100,000 @ 5 for 100 days = GBP 1,369.86
The local equivalent of GBP 1369.86 @1.48= USD 2027.39 (1.48 being the SELL rate).
If the Drawing were contracted at 1.45 and the payment currency is USD (Local),
Then the credit amount shall be USD 145,000 - 2,027.39 = USD 142,972.61

	/* Drawings is an application under the Letter of Credit system that is used to effect the transfer of funds and the acceptance of documents under Letters of Credit and Documentary Collection transaction.  The system is fully integrated within T24 to provide Accounting, Limit Exposure, Position Updating, Control and actual administration of L/C Collection activity together with ensuring efficient delivery of the related Advices, Documents, Covering Letters, and Payments.
In order to enter a drawing, the Letter of Credit Collection parent contract must first be set up in order to define the types of drawings that can be made.
The main type of transactions that the system processes are as follows:

Acceptance of Documents (AC)
After checking that the documents presented comply with the terms and conditions of the LC, the bank will accept a bill of exchange on behalf of the beneficiary, which can then be discounted by the bank.  This is a term or usance type drawing.

Deferred Payment (DP)
After checking that the documents presented comply with the terms and conditions of the LC, an undertaking is given by the Bank for payment to be made at a future date.  This type can be discounted by the bank in order to effect payment to the beneficiary at an earlier date, although reimbursement will not be received by the bank until the aforementioned future date.

Sight Payment (SP)
After checking that the documents presented comply with the terms and conditions of the LC, immediate payment is effected to the Beneficiary/ Collecting Bank and reimbursement obtained from applicant/opening bank.

Collections for L/C (CO)
If there are any discrepancies in the documents presented for payment/ acceptance, they can be handled on a collection basis whereby the Documents are presented to the LC application for their authorisation to pay/accept.

Collection Chase for L/C or D/C (CC)
Used to chase drawings that have been sent for collection.  Currently this will be performed manually by entering a change to the existing drawing type (from CO to CC), but a facility exists to automate this so that collection chases will be produced on a fixed date specified for the drawing.

Collection rejection for L/C or D/C (CR)
Used to signify that a drawing sent for collection has been rejected by the applicant or issuing bank.  If payment had been made under reserve, then funds will be claimed back from the Beneficiary.

Documentary Collection (DC)
For documentary collection,  this type of drawing is used to enter a collection into the system.  The documents will be passed from the Remitting bank through to the Drawee via the Collecting bank, for collection.  When payment is to be made, the drawing type is changed to 'SP'.
The main features of the application can be described as follows:
1. Input Processing
A stringent validation process is performed in order to ensure the correctness of any transaction input.  Which includes cross check with the parent L/C contract to enforce any restrictions imposed.  All inputs as applicable, will update limits, positions, accounts, etc. in real time. After authorization of the deal, all the documents, advices, covering letters, and S.W.I.F.T. messages applicable for the deal will be automatically generated by the Electronic Delivery System.
The account to debit can be in a different currency to that of the LC. In this case the system will automatically calculate the foreign exchange necessary using current mid market buy and sell rates plus customer spread rates.  This exchange rate can be overridden by entering a specific rate to be used.
The drawings entered will also update statistics held on the parent L/C record to show drawings outstanding, collections outstanding, total amount discounted etc.
2. Charge Processing
Default charges for all types of Drawing can be entered via the LC.TXN.TYPE.CONDITION file, and will be automatically calculated by the system.  The facility to add extra charges or amend charges is available, together with the facility to waive all charges.  All charge entries are automatically generated, and if specified in a foreign currency, positions will be updated accordingly.  Charges can be amortised over the life of the contract, at frequencies defined by the user.
Charges can be claimed from a number of parties involved in the Letter of Credit or Documentary Collection.  It is important to note that charges can be denominated in a currency other than the Letter of Credit/ Documentary Collection Currency.
Whenever a sight drawing is entered that will effect a payment or claim reimbursement, the system will automatically deduct the outstanding charges from the payment amount, or add the total charges to the reimbursement amount, as indicated in the relevant charges fields.
With regards to Acceptance/Deferred Payment drawings, charges will be taken at the first maturity, which may not necessarily be relative to the first acceptance of documents.  LC requests drafts at 120 days after Bill of Lading date
e.g.       1st drawing payable 20.12.93            2nd drawing could be payable 18.12.93
All outstanding charges will therefore be taken 18.12.93
3. Document Processing
All documents required to be produced by the input of the transaction will be generated by the Electronic Delivery System in order to facilitate easy amendment and customisation of the forms.  Large amounts of text can be entered using the WordPerfect application, and then linked into the L/C documents by simply entering the file name of the WordPerfect ASCII file into the field provided on the screen.
Frequently used text and clauses can be entered via the LC.ADVICE.TEXT and LC.CLAUSES applications, and then linked into the transaction by entering a short code into the fields provided.
The word processing system presently used is WordPerfect, but any other package can easily be incorporated into the system.
4. Inquiries and Reports
In common with other T24 Applications all data can be enquired upon or selectively analyzed and researched.  The system will also automatically produce reports of Collections Due, Unpaid Charges, etc. */

		/* This field displays a code to specify what type of drawing this is.
This code identifies which kind of Drawing is being made under the L/C, and will impact the kind of processing done. The following types can be entered for a new drawing:
AC - Acceptance (Usance credits)
DP - Deferred Payment (Usance credits)
RP - Release Payment
SP - Sight Payment
CO - L/C Collection
The following types can only be entered as a change to an existing drawing:
CC - Collection Chase
CR - Collection Rejection
FR - Final Rejection
MA - Matured Acceptance
MD - Matured Deferred Payment.
AD-Amendment to drawings (only SP/MA/MD drawings can be amended using AD)
For Drawing types of 'AC' and 'DP', a term or usance credit is established whereby the funds will be debited and paid on the MATURITY.REVIEW date specified later. If the funds are required to be paid before this date, the Drawing can be Discounted, whereby payment is made on the Value date specified, but reimbursement is obtained on the MATURITY.REVIEW date.
If 'SP' is entered, then both Payment and reimbursement is made on the VALUE.DATE specified.
For 'AC' and 'DP' type drawings, once the maturity review date is reached and the drawing undergoes maturity processing, then the Drawing type will automatically change to 'MA' (From 'AC'), and 'MD' (From 'DP'), indicating that these deals are now matured. However, it is to be noted that for Export Usance Drawing  to Mature automatically, either the CONFIRM.INST in LC should hold  the value  as CONFIRM or  the Drawing must have been  discounted. In absence of  either of these the Drawing has to be manually matured. In the case of Import Usance Drawing is maturity is always automatic with an  option for the user to manually mature the same.
If an authorised 'CO' is changed to a 'CC', then the system will perform chasing logic (ie. produce chase advices), and the reset the drawing type back to its original value, once authorised.
When a drawing type of RP is used for an Export LC, this will generate a message (MT754) acknowledging documents were presented in accordance with the terms and conditions of the underlying credit and also a claim for reimbursement (MT742). Alternatively, an Import LC will generate the release of a payment, to the beneficiary, in the form of a Customer Transfer (MT100).
A Final Rejection (FR) is normally used when the Sender considers the documents, not to be in accordance with the terms and conditions of the credit, and consequently, refuses them. The difference between drawing type FR and CR is that using type CR will generate a message denoting advice of refusal (MT734) and FR will only ever generate a letter denoting Advice of Refusal/Rejection (1734). Note that this drawing type may only be used following a Collection Rejection (CR).
Amendment to Drawing (AD) is permitted to facilitate messaging activity by enabling to alter text and/or local fields.
Note : Neither a type FR or RP will reduce Drawings limits.

This field holds the activity number, which is triggered by the latest activity in the life-cycle of the transaction.. The activity is 4 digit number composed of three main parts:


First indicates the operation


1 - Represents &#145;O&#146; or         &#145;P&#146; operation in LETTER.OF.CREDIT

2 - Represents &#145;A&#146;,         &#145;C&#146; or &#145;T&#146; operation in         LETTER.OF.CREDIT

3 - Represents Sight Drawing Operation in         DRAWINGS

4 - Represents Usance Drawing Operation in         DRAWINGS


Second indicates the type of instrument


1 - Represents Outward Collection

2 - Represents Inward Collection

4 - Represents Export Letter of Credit

8 - Represents Import Letter of Credit


And the last two digit indicate the detail         activity related to that operation.

For example. : For the L/C Export Sight Payment activity, the first digit will be &#145;3&#146;. The second digit will be &#145;4&#146; and the last two digits will be &#145;01&#146; (to indicate basic INPUT/AUTHORIZE operation). Thus the activity for Export Sight Drawing will be LC-3401.

	/* Letter of Credit controls the administration and processing of both Letters of Credit and Documentary Collections. It is fully integrated within T24.
It automates accounting, limit exposure, position updating, control and administration of trading activity and ensures efficient delivery of the related advices, documents, and payments.
The Letter of Credit types processed by the system can be customised using the LC.TYPES application, where combinations of the major features of an LC can be set up. (e.g. import/export, sight/usance (term), confirmed/unconfirmed, etc.)
It is important to note that the details set up on the Letter of Credit application do not make any payments or reimbursements.  In order to achieve this, a Drawing must be entered via the DRAWINGS application. This will be linked to the LETTER.OF.CREDIT contract.
A history of each LETTER.OF.CREDIT contract. and in particular the charges processed for the contract, is held on the LC.ACCOUNT.BALANCES application.
Many events occur within the life of a LETTER.OF.CREDIT contract. Each event is recorded on the contract by (I)nputting to the contract and usually the OPERATION field on the contract will control the event being entered.

The main transactions that the system can process are:

ISSUANCE OF A LETTER OF CREDIT
Used when the Bank opens a Letter of Credit on behalf of its client (applicant) which will be advised to the beneficiary, via the Bank's correspondent.  Usually in the country that the beneficiary resides.

ADVISING/CONFIRMING A LETTER OF CREDIT
Used when the Bank receives a Letter of Credit that has been issued by another Bank and is requested to forward it.  (Sometimes via a third party Bank) to the beneficiary with or without adding confirmation.

PRE-ADVISE A LETTER OF CREDIT
At the request of the applicant, a pre-advice is sent by the issuing Bank, prior to their issuance of the operative credit instrument, to provide the beneficiary, via the advising bank, with brief details of the LC which is in the process of being opened.

AMENDMENT OF A LETTER OF CREDIT
This facility will allow the user to insert any changes which will produce an amendment to the original terms and conditions of an LC and automatically generate all relevant accounting entries for commissions, increase or decrease of the principal amounts, and advices and documents to the Electronic delivery system.

OPEN A REMITTANCE DOCUMENTARY COLLECTION (EXPORT)
Used when the Bank (acting as Remitting Bank) receives a Documentary Collection from its client (the drawer) in respect of goods/services they have sold to their customer (the drawee).  The bank forwards the documents to their Correspondent (The Collecting Bank) in the country of residency of the drawer for presentation to the drawee against payment/acceptance.

OPEN A COLLECTING DOCUMENTARY COLLECTION (IMPORT)
Used when the Bank (acting as Collecting Bank) receives a Documentary Collection from another Bank (The Remitting Bank) for  presentation to the Bank's client (the drawee) against payment/acceptance.


MAIN FEATURES OF THE APPLICATION --------------------------------

The main features of the module can be described as follows:

1. INPUT PROCESSING
Validation is performed to ensure the correctness of any transaction input.  All inputs will update limits, positions, accounts, etc.. in real time.  After authorization of the transaction, all the documents, advices, and SWIFT messages applicable for the L/C will be automatically generated by the Electronic Delivery System.
All L/C types can be entered in local or foreign currencies, i.e. contracts can be denominated in any currency.

2. CHARGE PROCESSING
Default charges for all types of Letters of Credit and Documentatary Collections can be entered via the LC.TXN.TYPE.CONDITION application, and will be automatically calculated by the system.  The facility to add extra charges or amend charges is available, together with the facility to waive all charges.  All charge entries are automatically generated, and if specified in a foreign currency, positions will be updated accordingly.  Charges can be amortised over the life of the contract, frequencies defined by the user.
Charges can be claimed from a number of parties involved in the Letter of Credit or Documentary Collection.  It is important to note that charges can be denominated in a currency other than the Letter of Credit /Documentary Collection Currency.
Once an LC is authorised, all charges are recorded in the LC.ACCOUNT.BALANCES file. Should further charges be input the file will automatically be updated.

3. DOCUMENT PROCESSING
All documents required to be produced by the input of the transaction will be generated by the Delivery application in order to facilitate easy amendment and customisation of the forms. The T24 Graphical User Interface provides a simple way of entering large volumes of text.
Frequently used text and clauses can be entered via the LC.ADVICE.TEXT and LC.CLAUSES applications, and then linked into the transaction by entering a short code into the fields provided.

4. ENQUIRIES AND REPORTS
In common with other T24 Applications, all data can be enquired upon or selectively analyzed and researched.  The system will also automatically produce reports of Collections Due, Unpaid Charges, etc. */

O - Open new Letter of Credit / Documentary Collection contract, P - Preadvise new Letter of Credit contract, A - Amend an existing Letter of Credit / Documentary Collection contract, C - Direct charge processing for an existing contract, T - Trace existing Documentary Collection contract, D - Decision on an Amendment.
Operation 'C' provides the operator with the ability to either record a new charge or amend (not cancel or write-off) a previously input charge. Operation 'C' also displays all uncollected charges (having null status) in LC.ACCOUNT.BALANCES, which are available to the operator to amend. However, keeping the status unchanged at null will enable the system to rewrite the charges back in LC.ACCOUNT.BALANCES.
To ensure that no fee/charges are accidentally deleted or 'lost' from the system, once a charge set has been input, it cannot be deleted. However such a charge can be written off in LC.ACCOUNT.BALANCES.
When accessed the contract will be shown with all relevant fields in their amended state, except charges set.
When using 'T' trace, an MT420 will be produced and the next process date will have to be modified.
Operation D is used when a decision on a Pending Amendment is to be taken as either Approved or Rejected. Use of this option opens up AMEND.NO and AMEND.STATUS. to use this the Letter of Credit has to be previously authorised in its O status.

Validation Rules
