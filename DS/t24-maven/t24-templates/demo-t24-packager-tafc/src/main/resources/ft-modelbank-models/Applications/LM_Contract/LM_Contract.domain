	/* The LMM.ACCOUNT.BALANCES file contains the financial information pertinent to all LOANS AND DEPOSITS & MONEY MARKET contracts. There is only one version of the record and it is established when a contract is first input and validated.
The information that this record contains can be classified into four main sections:
(i) Principal movements over the life of the contract.
(ii) Interest accrual details.
(iii) Commission accrual details.
(iv) Funds paid/received on the contract.
All updates to this file are effected automatically by the system and the only functions users are allowed to perform are (L)IST, (S)EE and (P)RINT.
When a contract is written to history, either due to reversal or maturity, its LMM.ACCOUNT.BALANCES record is also written to history, although this may be "n" days after the reversal or maturity (as per field DAYS.POST.MATURITY on LMM.INSTALL.CONDS record). */

		/* The record identification.
This field is the key of the record and is always the contract number, e.g. LD/86255/00123 or MM/86255/00123, plus a two digit suffix. The two digit suffix identifies the nature and type of record ie:-
00        For LD contracts, the 00 relates to the extent of "our           share". All MM contracts end with 00. 01-98     relates to Syndicated contracts and identifies the           participant's number and share. 99        relates to the total of the syndication. Therefore type           "99" will reflect the total exposure to the customer in           relation to fields "00" to "98".
There is only one of these records at any one time representing either the unauthorised or authorised record on the LD.LOANS.AND.DEPOSITS or MM.MONEY.MARKET main files.

If there are no interest rate or principal changes within a given interest period then the value in this field will not change throughout the life of the interest period.  If one of these components change, or indeed the interest period itself is changed, then the Committed interest amount will be recalculated.
Discounted contracts will show the amount of interest paid/received at the start of the current interest period and will not change this field during the current interest period.
This field has three main uses:
1.        On the Confirmation of the deal to the customer,           specifying the interest amount for the interest period.
2.        As an internal piece of information such as a forecast           of an interest movement across an account           (FWD.ENTRY file).
3.        As a check against rounding errors.  e.g. Three days           interest may compute 10 yet three daily accruals may           calculate 9.99 (3 x 3.33).  In this eventuality, the           last accrual is adjusted to 3.34 so that the sum of the           accruals always equals the COMMITTED INT amount at           the end of the interest period.

		/* The outstanding principal balance as of the DATE INT ACC TO field in this multivalue set of accrual fields (fields 52 to 57).
Whenever an interest accrual takes place, fields 52 to 57 inclusive are updated with the components used in the accrual calculation.  These fields are PRINC INT BAL (the balance of principal on the Contract); AC INT RATE (the actual interest rate used in the calculation); AC INT SPREAD (the interest spread, if applicable); DATE INT ACC TO (the date interest is accrued to); and the resulting interest amount fields - INT AMT TODATE (rounded) and ACTUAL ACC AMT (not rounded).
So as to keep a full history of the interest accrual during the current interest period, these fields are multivalue associated and each time one of the calculation components changes, a new set of values is added.
This field, PRINC INT BAL, is calculated by summing the OUTS CURR PRINC  and OUTS OD PRINC fields to arrive at a net outstanding principal balance.  It is signed negative for asset contracts and positive for liability contracts. An example of how this field, and the other accrual fields are used is shown below:
Example:  Asset contract, valued 11th February 1987, Maturing           11th March 1987.  Principal is one million pounds,           interest rate is fixed at 10%, accruals are performed           daily and the first day accrual method is employed.
State of fields prior to first accrual:

Note:     One days interest has been calculated, the fields in           the calculation have been updated and the final field           OUTS ACCRUED INT has been updated.
State of fields after second accrual:

Note:     Another days interest has been calculated and added           to OUTS ACCRUED INT.  Because the components in           the interest calculation were no different to the first           accrual, a new set of accrual details were not added           but the amount and date fields were changed.
If, prior to the third accrual, a prepayment of 250,000 principal was made, valued 13th February, the state of the fields after the third accrual would be as follows:
State of fields after third accrual:
CURRENCY        :   GBP DATE FROM       :   11th February 1987 EFFECTIVE DATE  :   11th February 1987 TRANS PRIN AMT  :   - 1,000,000 OUTS FWD PRINC  :   0 OUTS CURR PRINC :   - 1,000,000 OUTS OD PRINC   :      250,000 OUTS ACCRUED INT    :         - 753.43

Note:     This time, another set of accrual fields have been           written because the principal balance has changed.           Another result of the principal change is that the           COMMITTED INT field has been re-calculated.
An example for a deposit contract would be similar to the one above with the following exceptions:
1.        Amounts would have the opposite sign.
2.        The OUTS ACCRUED INT field would be replaced by           the OUTS CUR ACC I PAY field.
The field AC INT SPREAD is only used when the contract is tied to a floating interest rate.  In this case the AC INT RATE is still the actual interest rate used in the calculation but this time it includes the interest spread as shown in AC INT SPREAD.
