	/* OVERVIEW OF MISCELLANEOUS DEALS - MAIN FILE
The Miscellaneous Deals module provides the facility to record deals which are off balance sheet. The principal amounts involved are booked as contingent entries. Facilities are provided for making charges and printing advices and confirmations. Limit checking is supported.
In the event of participation entered in the Deal, the same may be recorded to the extent of participation. Although when a Deal is participated, movement of principal is not permitted, yet when ASSET.LIAB.NETTING is set to YES, such a movement of principal would be permitted. Such a flag also decides the amount for which contingent entry would be raised either for the Deal amount or to the extent of T24 Bank's participation.
Charges maybe taken online or scheduled for a future date. Whenever, an event is scheduled for a future date in MD, the system updates the same in a file MD.SCHEDULES.
Concurrently, where the User chooses to collect commission the same is permitted. The option on collection of these, however remains with the user. Charge and Commission collection are mutually exclusive. Tax may also be attached to such a Charge or Commission.
In relation to commission, it can either be taken upfront or at the end of the Contract. The system either amortizes or accrues the same in the frequency as defined in the parameter. This scheduling of Commission can either be in terms of manual schedule or defined as a  frequency. It is but imperative that Commission debit account is always in the Deal currency.
This commission may either be taken as a percentage of a fixed amount. When set as a percentage, the option to input a spread is available. By defining the appropriate MD.TXN.TYPE.CONDITION, it is possible to define a minimum commission amount for a Deal. This definition can also be done currency-wise.
As MD, can be used for issuance of Guarantee, the system permits the user to collect Cash Margin for the same. Such a Cash Margin may be collected at the time of positive principal movement or any time online.
In the event of a Principal decrease, the system permits release of cash margin on the event date. Release of provision (Cash Margin) could be carried out online or any future date as well.
Such a cash margin, maybe taken in a currency different from that of the Deal currency and maybe parked in an account of different currency. An option to define a default MD Margin account is available in the parameter. In the event of such a margin taken, the user may choose to decide as the whether such margin should have an impact on the limit line or not.
The commission input in the Deal is not changeable, however by defining the Deal Sub Type and the Category, the rate change may be effected through the application MD.CSN.RATE.CHANGE. It also enables a retrospective rate change.
The support to MT760, MT767, MT768 and MT769 is available.
In the event of a Guarantee being requested to be issued by a correspondent Bank, an option is available to impact the limit of Correspondent Bank, besides the applicant customer.
Invocation of guarantee is supported along with the requisite messaging, appropriating the Provision and the share of participation if any. Where the invocation results in overdraft of a customer account, the PD link has been provided.
Although the contingent entries are generated at End of Day, there is an option to trigger the same online. This when set, generates the movement entries at Start of Day. The maturity however is done only at End of Day.
If MD, were to be used to issue a shipping guarantee, the system supports appropriation of Cash margin taken in LC into that of MD. The requisite LC reference and the appropriation amount has to be decided by the user. Thus when a Drawing is done under the Letter of Credit, quoting the reference of the MD.DEAL, the system understands the link and generates the accounting accordingly.
Link to Syndicated Loans:
When a Guarantee Deal is linked to Syndicated Loans, input of SL ref in the Deal triggers the requisite validations. This link to SL module is enabled only for issue of Guarantee (CA) type. Firstly, Facility should have been marked as available and its status is set as CUR. The customer of the MD.DEAL should have been defined as that of Facility or one of its allowed Customers. The currency defined in the Deal, should either be a permitted currency of the Facility or should not have been defined as a restricted currency. On input of amount, the system validates, the permitted or available amount in the referred Tranche of the Facility and this validation also caters to the exposure of each of the participants if exist in the Facility. Likewise the Date of the Deal cannot be prior to start of the Tranche Date under which it is drawn. Currently no Principal movement is permitted for such linked Deals.
If charges were to be taken, the same is permissible only in cases where a linked deal is devoid of Participants. In cases, where participation exists in these Deals, the charges are to be collected from SL charges.


When linked the Commission shall always be that of End type and the rate for the Deal currency would either be picked up Facility if found to be of the same currency, if not as defined in SL.FACI.RATES. The user has the option to amend the system defaulted rate. The commission shall always be collected as a frequency as defined in the Facility for Interest (
INT.DUE.DATE
ASSET.LIAB.NETTING
NET.PRIN.AMOUNT


Although, in the event of Facility having its share of Participants, the MD.DEAL, may be amended to hold the share in a proportion different from that of the Facility. The default however, would be the distribution of Deal amount in the same ratio as in Facility. But at all times the exposure shall validate against the relevant files in the SL module, viz., SL.EXPOSURE.LEVEL, SL.FACI.BALANCES and SL.FACI.PART.BALANCES.
