Basic parameters for the type of the event will have to be defined in DIARY.TYPE application. Using this event type, details of the forthcoming actual event are entered in this application. The EVENT.TYPE field in this application controls the input/update of various fields.
DIARY record can be created both manually and by an Extel Financials data feed.
DIARY record will record the actual details of the event, event type, number of new shares for old, amount of dividend etc.
Once the DIARY record has been authorised, user will be able to choose an option of creating ENTITLEMENT record online or during End Of Day process. Entitlement records are created for each portfolio of the Security the DIARY record has been raised for.

Validation Rules

SEC.HOLD.SETTLE will allow input of #145;YES#146; or #145;NO#146; only.

If the ACTUAL.SETTLEMENT field on the SC.PARAMETER record is #145;NO#146; then SEC.HOLD.SETTLE will be no-input field that will default to #145;NO#146;.

If DIARY transaction is authorised with SEC.HOLD.SETTLE field set to #145;YES#146; then the system will create a SC.SETTLEMENT record from the transaction.SC.SETTLEMENT         records will be created with an unauthorised status.The         stock settlement can be recorded using the NOM.RECD.DEL         field in SC.SETTLEMENT.

If the user has input #145;YES#146; in the SEC.HOLD.SETTLE field of a transaction and consequently is processing the stock nominal through actual settlement then the system         will update UNSETTLE.NOMINAL field on the SECURITY.POSITION         file with the nominal of the transaction when the SC.SETTLEMENT         record is created. Where the security position is being         added to (a purchase for example) this field will be         credited with the stock. Where the security position is         being debited (a sell for example) this field will be         debited with the nominal. */
