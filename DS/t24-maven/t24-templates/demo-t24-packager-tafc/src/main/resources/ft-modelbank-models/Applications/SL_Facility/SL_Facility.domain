	/* On flagging CREATE.FACILITY field in PRESYNDICATION.FILE, appropriate            facility records are created in IHLD status.
Currently direct creation of facility record otherwise than through            Presyndication file is not permitted. Hence, the records created in            IHLD status cannot be deleted until first authorisation.
In the FACILITY file the bank may record details of type of credit            line, it validity in terms of drawings and maturity, the countries            of risk and exposure, the rate of commitment fee and its calculation            methodology, the rates and method of calculation of interest for            drawings under the line, details of participation and the            appropriate lending  rates applicable to each participant etc.
In the event that the bank desires to phase out disbursement, it            would be possible to break the facility into different tranches.            Both sequential and overlapping types of tranches may be defined. It            would be possible to record the details of participation at the            tranche level as well as other covenants like currencies in which            drawings are permissible and currencies prohibited, the validity of            the tranche, the customers who may draw under the tranche and the            amounts reserved and allowed to them, the maximum number of loans            and currrencies in which drawings are permissible under the tranche etc. */

		/* Identifies the manner in which overdue payments are handled.                    The default for all contracts is AUTOMATIC.
Two options are provided;
AUTOMATIC - When a commitment fee schedule is processed,                    accounting entries would be passed across the liquidation                    account for the entire dues and the respective                    participant's share would be disbursed through their                    Nostro accounts automatically. In this scenario, the Agent                    expects funds to be credited to his Nostro on the due dates                    and hence automates the liquidation and disbursement entries.
INTERNAL - In this scenario the Agent would pay the                    participants only on actual receipt of funds in his                    Nostro/liquidation account. The Agent's share (in case                    the Agent is also a participant) would be liquidated to the                    account provided in the deal for the respective due but no                    amounts would be disbursed to the participants. The overdue                    amounts would get captured in SL.OD.DUES and SL.OD.PART                    files. On receipt of funds, the application SL.OD.DUES may                    be used to pay off the participant's share as well as                    to reverse out own share in the internal account where                    Agent's share is stored.
In case the borrower has followed a different method of                    rounding with that compared to the Agent, the                    participant's share of interest, commitment fee and tax                    on both could differ. In such scenario the borrower would                    remit an amount different to the one calculated and stored                    by the Agent in his overdue files. Hence an application                    SL.ROUND.ADJ has been provided where the Agent could                    re-allocate the share of interest, commitment fee and tax                    thereon between the participants, to be in line with the                    borrower's calculation. This front-end could also be                    used in case the Agent does a skimming of the interest (on                    loans) or commitment fee. In this case the borrower is                    charged a different rate than the one quoted by the                    participants and the Agent skims the difference.
Liquidation mode INTERNAL could hence be used where ;
(a) The agent would repay the participants only on sighting                    the funds
(b) Where the agent would require to do rounding adjustments                    to re-allocate the participant's share

In case disbursement is phased out, the bank may define                    different tranches, each with  distinct validity, amount and purpose.
This field is used to store the reference number of tranche                    and when loans are drawn, the reference in this field is                    quoted in order to identify the tranche against which the                    drawing is made.
The reference number of a tranche within a presyndication                    reference (multiple facility records within the same presyn                    record) has to be unique.

SL0025000012-02 - Non revolving GBP facility with two tranches
SL0025000012-03.- Non revolving GBP facility with three tranches
The tranche code of all tranches within SL0025000012 have to                    be unique.
Hence, the tranche code could be defined as follows;

Principal or Interest or commitment                    fee etc.  Presently it has five values viz.   0 - OTHERS   1                    - PRINCIPAL                         2 - COMMITMENT FEE     3                    - INTEREST     4 - CHARGES
The fourth digit indicates to whom the message is being                    generated, whether to the participant or to the borrower  or                    to both.  Presently it has three values viz.  1 -                    PARTICIPANT ONLY                             2 - PARTICIPANT                    AND BORROWER    3 - BORROWER ONLY
For example when a new facility is granted, the activity                    generated would be SL-2102 meaning 2-FACILITY, 1-INPUT,                    0-OTHERS(since it involves all components) and                    2-PARTICIPANTS AND BORROWER.

Though the processing of MD deal would be done by the MD module the management of facility would be handled in SL module.
This field is a mutivalue field which can accept all the three defined values there by enabling the Facility to be utilised on any of the defined multiple products.
This field has the Associated set of fields PRODUCT.AMT,PRODUCT.TR.CODE, PRODUCT.TR.AMT for defining multiple product utilisation for the facility amount under each tranche
An example to define the Functionality
The field PRODUCT.TYPE and PRODUCT.AMT is used to define the amount utilisation under the product and the associated sub-value fields PRODUCT.TR.CODE and PROD.TR.AMT is used to define the Tranche level utilisation on each Product.
Consider a Total Facility amount of 100M with TR1 as 50M, TR2 as 30M and TR3 as 20M
The PRODUCT.TYPE and PRODUCT.AMT can be defined as below
LOANS USD 100M(LN-PRODUCT)   TR1 50M, TR2 30M, TR3 20M
GTEES USD 100M(GT-PRODUCT)   TR1 50M, TR2 30M, TR3 20M
SBLC's USD 100M(SC-PRODUCT)   TR1 50M, TR2 30M, TR3 20M , The tranche codes and amounts can be defined in PRODUCT.TR.CODE and PRODUCT.TR.AMT
The above examples determines that a Facility of 100M can be utilised in the LN product type by a maximum of 50M utilisation from TR1, 30M from TR2 and 20M from TR3. Similarly for the GT and SC products. The amount utilisation is in the first come first serve basis and the utilisation on each product is allowed only on the outstanding tranche amount
Allowed values in this field are LN, SC, GT.
LN implies Loan Product
SC implies Stand by Letter of Credit
GT implies Guarantee assistance.
Validation Rules

Default value is Null implying loan type product.
Sum of the product amount can be greater than the Facility amount
Sum of the PRODUCT.TR.AMT should be equal to the PRODUCT.AMT */
