	/* The Agency File contains settlement details of major customers and all banks irrespective of whether there is any business connection. Details include any arrangements.  Account relationships and, where possible, the Agents correspondent bankers for specific currencies. This information is entered centrally to supply Automatic Routing instructions for remittances/cover to all banks and customers with whom the Bank has numerous dealings.  This eliminates the need to re-enter the details at transaction level.  It thus allows full advantage to be taken of electronic delivery facilities by providing, automatically, the settlement agents for remittances/cover involved in outward payments.
The absence of Agent's correspondent bankers information in this file will force the user to enter these details each time at the transaction level.
Any Nostro account defined in this table is for information only and will not be used as a default Nostro by the Transaction Processing Application which always uses the NOSTRO.ACCOUNT file.
The basic details of these banks and major customers must first be defined in the Customer file before the creation of the Agent details will be allowed.  Having created a Customer record, which is a Bank, it is advisable to create an Agency record with the same key, and all available autorouting details. */

		/* This field defines whether the brokerage calculation will be carried out on either a FIXED basis, a PERIOD basis or a PRESENT.VALUE basis.
For the FIXED basis the brokerage calculated igonres the period of the contract and returns an amount based solely on the contract principal.
Example: A loan matches a deal type defined on the BROKER record which will use the FIXED basis. The principal on the contract is 1,000 GBP. If the percentage rate for the deal type is set at 1% and the broker currency set to GBP the resulting brokerage amount will be 100 GBP.

For the PERIOD basis the length of the contract is used in the calculation of the brokerage amount. The unit period for calculation (360 or 365 days) is based on the default basis of the contract currency.
Example: A deposit matches a deal type defined on the BROKER record which will use the PERIOD basis. The principal on the contract is 10,000 GBP for a period of two years. If the percentage rate for the deal type is set at 1% the resulting brokerage amount will be 10 GBP for each year, for a total of 200 GBP.
N.B.  Unless FIXED is specified on this record for the deal type defined for the sub value group, the calculation uses the PERIOD basis, except for brokerage taken on Letter of Credit Drawings, the FIXED basis is always used regardless of contents of this field.

For PRESENT.VALUE the PV formula will be used in the brokerage calculation.
The PRESENT.VALUE calc.type is primarily for the brokerage calculation of the interest rate swap contracts.

For Example: An IRS of GBP 10M with Bank A paying 6.72% fixed semi-annually and receiving floating from Bank B. Value date is 03 Apr 1998 and maturity date is 03 Apr 2002. With brokerage rate set to 0.01% and applying the above formula, the brokerage will be calculated as GBP 3,457.15.

Validation Rules

Must either be FIXED, PERIOD or PRESENT.VALUE.

The first two digits of the Category code represent the highest level of classification and the next three digits represent a sub-classification which provides a clear definition of the profit and loss or product type.
Care should be taken when defining additional sub-classifications that sufficient detail does not already exist to provide the required breakdown. For example, it does not warrant defining separate Category codes for resident and non-resident Customers or for local and foreign currency transactions, since this information is already available on an individual Prime record.
A table of possible values and definitions of the first two digits of Category codes have been pre-defined within T24 and is included in the documentation of the record ID of this table.  The sub-classifications will be defined separately within each System.

	/* The Transaction Table contains information about all the Transaction Codes which may be used within T24  For each Application a range of Transaction codes has been assigned to facilitate their recognition and identification within T24  The Transaction codes contain and identify important processing conditions which will be defaulted by the Applications if no other input has been entered at the transaction level.  The main identifying details of the Transaction code can be summarised as follows:
1. Reference number identification
In many cases, the System will be required to capture a reference number either to print or for verification against the Database.  This will be the case, when cheques are issued by customers on their account with the Bank.
It will be important to verify these cheques, when presented for payment, against the "stop payment" list and to receive a stop payment warning as soon as the transaction is processed.  By defining the appropriate details in this table, this control will be completely automated.
2. Transaction Charges
For each Transaction code it is also possible to define, if required, different types of charges applicable to the specific Transaction. Many banks, for example, charge their customer for services like standing orders, use of Cash Dispensers, issuance of cheques, etc. This table will allow identification of these charges at the Transaction Type level.  Any of these charges can then be processed by the Interest and Charge System, possibly depending on the minimum balance in the account.
3. Default Value and Exposure date
As a further facility, this table will allow the definition of the default Value Date and Exposure Date conditions for each Transaction code. This will prevent the operator from having to key the Value Date and Exposure Date repeatedly on transactions where a default can be applied.
4. MIS Information
A unit cost can also be associated with each Transaction code.  This will allow Customer and Account profitability to be produced taking into account not only the earnings detained from the Customer but also the cost included in providing the services to customers.
The other facilities available in this table are detailed within the Field descriptions.
The TRANSACTION.CHARGE table (ref: ACCOUNT) must be set up before any charge can be defined in a Transaction code.
For each Transaction code, the corresponding Narrative to be printed on the statement of Account must be defined in the DELIVERY TRANSLATION table (DE.TRANSLATION).  A clear and precise Narrative will eliminate the need to send additional advices to support statement entries.
5. Combining Entries.
The way that T24 combines accounting entries is defined in this table. It is possible to define rules for various categories, products and transaction code.
For example, it is possible to specify a transaction code that will be used as the combined transaction code for all Loans contracts using a specific transaction code. */

2.         The input of Y will also ensure that the cheque number            is available for printing on the Customer statement            which will allow easy reconciliation for the Customer.

If Y, or N(O) are entered the inputs (a) to (f) are not allowed.
(a), (bb), (c) specify the number of calendar or working days to be added/subtracted to/from the Run Date in order to obtain the Default Value Date as follows:
(a) +      If days are to be added to the Run Date.  The '+' sign            should normally be used for credit Entries.            -        If days are to be subtracted from the Run                     Date.  The '-' sign should normally be used                     for Debit entries.
(bb) 01-99Indicates the number of days to be added or                     subtracted.
(c) C    If (bb) are calendar days,                W    If (bb) are working days.
If it is necessary to add/subtract any other days to            those specified in (bb) before obtaining the Default            Value Date then (d), (ee), (f) are used as follows:
(d)      As for (a) previously.
(ee)     As for (bb) previously.
(f) C    If ee are calendar days.                W    If ee are working days.
It must be noted that the day type ('C' or 'W') can only            be used once in an equation.
Note:      It is important to realise that the conditions defined in            this field are only Applicable for the DATA CAPTURE            Application.  All other Applications have their Value            Date conditions defined by their own tables.
This field allows a Default Value Date to be specified for a DATA.CAPTURE transaction either, equal to the Run Date, or the Run Date plus or minus a number of working or calendar days.  This prevents the operator from having to key the Value Date on DATA.CAPTURE transactions repeatedly, where a default can be applied.  It can be overridden at Transaction level when required.
Example: +03W       will mean that the default value date is 3 working days            forward from the Run Date.
+01C + 02W  will mean that the default value date is 1 calendar day +            2 working days forward from the Run date.
Validation Rules
Y    If the Default Value Date is to be the Run Date. or      N(O) If a Default Value Date is not to be generated automatically.  Value Date must  then be input manually when Transaction Code is used. or      (a) (bb) (c) (d) (ee) (f) As defined in the example below (Mandatory input when Field 2, DATA CAPTURE = 'Y', otherwise not allowed.)
Run Date is the date of the data being processed which may not always be today's date.  If different, the Run Date is displayed next to the User ID on the screen.
When defining the default value date for a CREDIT transaction code, the user must be careful when specifying the value of the next field (Default Exposure Date).  Very often the Default Exposure Date will depend on the Default Value Date.
The same day type ('C' or 'W') can only be used once in an equation ie. +01C + 02C will not be accepted.
When both working and calendar days are entered, the sign must be the same i.e. +01C - 02W will not be accepted. */

If Y, or NO is entered the inputs (a) to (f) are not allowed.  (a), (bb), (c) specify the number of calendar or working days to be added to the Run Date in order to obtain the Default Exposure Date as follows:
(a) +      Indicates that days are to be added to the Run Date.            The - sign is obviously not applicable for a default            exposure date and will always be refused. (bb) 01-99 Indicates the number of days to be added. (c) C      If (bb) are calendar days,     W      If (bb) are working days.
If it are necessary to add any other days to those            specified in (bb) before obtaining the Default Exposure            Date then (d), (ee), (f) are used as follows:
(d)  As for (a) previously.            (ee) As for (bb) previously.            (f) CIf (ee) are calendar days.                WIf (ee) are working days.
It must be noted that the day type ('C' or 'W') can only            be used once in an equation.
Note:      For the time being only the DATA.CAPTURE            Application makes use of the condition defined in this            field to define their default exposure date for credit            entries.
This field allows a Default Exposure Date to be specified for credit transactions, either on the Run Date, or a number of working or calendar days forward from the Run Date can be specified.  This controls when funds are available to the Customer and prevents the operator from repeatedly having to key the Exposure Date on Transactions where the default can be applied.  It can be overridden at Transaction level when required.
Example
+03W       will mean that the default value date is 3 working days            forward from the Run Date.
+01C + 02W  will mean that the default value date is 1 calendar day +            2 working days forward from the Run date.

Example:
The following example will clarify the use and the relations between the Default Value Date and Default Exposure Date fields.  Let us suppose that:
1.         Local currency cheques deposited by customers on their            account are credited immediately in the Customer            Account with a one working day Forward Value Date and            two working days Forward Exposure Date, i.e. the            funds will be cleared only two days after the cheque has            been deposited by the Customer.
2.         Foreign currency cheques, however, are credited, with            five working days Forward Value Date and eight            working days Forward Exposure Date, i.e. the funds            will be available to the customer only eight days after he            has deposited the cheque with you.
If these assumptions would be applicable then create two Transaction codes with the following values:
Field Name         Field Value
1.         ID                 001            Narrative          Cheque Deposit Local ccy            Deb/Cred Indicator C(redit)            Default value date + 01W            Default expos. date+ 02W            This transaction (001) will then be used to record local            currency cheque deposits.
2.         ID                 002            Narrative          Cheque Deposit Foreign ccy            Deb/Cred Indicator C(redit)            Default value date + 05W            Default Expos. date+ 08W
This transaction code (002) will then be used to record            foreign currency cheques deposit.
Validation Rules
Y    If the Default Exposure Date is to be the Run Date. or    N(O) If a Default Exposure Date is not to be generated automatically.  In this case, input of the exposure date will be requested at transaction level, when this transaction code is used. or    (a)(bb) (c) (d) (ee) (f) As defined in the example below. (Mandatory input when Field 2, DATA CAPTURE = 'Y', and Field 5, DEBIT CREDIT IND = 'C', otherwise not allowed.)
Run Date is the date of the data being processed which may not always be today's date.  If different, the Run Date is displayed next to the User ID on the screen.
The same day type can only be used once in an equation i.e. +01C + 02C will not be accepted.
When defining the Default Exposure Date for a credit Transaction code, the user must carefully check what has been entered for the Default Value Date. Very often the  conditions applicable to the Default Exposure Date will depend on the condition defined for the Default Value Date.
No input is allowed in this filed for transaction codes which have been flagged with the value of D in the field Debit/Credit indicator,  because all debit entries will always reduce the cleared balance immediately.
The CLEARED balance of the Account where the transaction is booked will be updated according to the value defined in this field.
Except for Reversals the Default Exposure is only applicable for Credit entries, all debit entries will reduce the CLEARED balance of the Account immediately regardless of the Value Date of the Transaction. (For Reversals, the opposite applies.)
When both working and Calendar days are entered, the sign must be the same i.e. +01C - 02W will not be accepted. */

Entries must have the same value date, account and currency market to be netted.
Note:
In COMBINE.TXN field, along with other TRANSACTION codes that are to be combined with this selected TRANSACTION, the ID of this selected TRANSACTION code also is to be mentioned.
Example:
If Charge defined by TRANSACTION 231 and tax defined by TRANSACTION 464 are to be combined with the charge defined by TRANSACTION 622 (ID of the selected TRANSACTION) , then select the multi value COMBINE.TXN field in TRANSACTION 622 and enter codes 231, 464 and  622 also.
Validation Rules

Must be a key to a valid record on this file, or ALL.
Where ALL is defined, no other transaction codes may be defined.
