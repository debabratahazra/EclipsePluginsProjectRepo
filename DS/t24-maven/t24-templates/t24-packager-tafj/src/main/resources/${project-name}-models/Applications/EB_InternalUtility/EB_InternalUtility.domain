	/* When a client purchases T24, he initially receives a copy of the T24 demonstration account. This account is a fully populated account, containing sample customers, accounts, transactions, etc. and includes all the products available in T24. The client can use the demo account to familiarise himself with the system, begin training his staff and decide how he would like his system configured. Data can be amended as required and End of Days run in it.
Once the client has decided on the configuration of his system, the Client Details form and the Client Implementation form at the back of this manual are completed and sent to the Distribution department at Temenos. Normally, the project manager from Temenos or one of Temenos' Business Partners would complete the form on the client's behalf.  It is very important that the client fully understands each of the questions asked on the form, as many of these settings cannot be changed after the tape has been generated.
Distribution will create an implementation tape according to the parameters and requirements entered on the Client Details and Implementation forms. This is then used as the starting point for the client's implementation.
Some clients who have purchased T24 for a number of different sites have adopted the practise of creating a "model bank".  This is normally created from the initial implementation tape.  The client then updates it with the customisation required for their bank.  For example, they will create SMS groups, versions, perhaps with additional validation in the form of user written subroutines, local reference fields, menus, enquiries including context sensitive enquiries and auto launch enquiries, additional helptext, etc.  Although all of this information can be transported by using the Data Library (see the Data Library chapter in the System Administration Guide), some clients prefer to be able to create their own implementation tapes from their "model bank".
Therefore, T24 has made the system generation tool available to selected clients: it is not generally available.  However, the client must always advice the Distribution department at Temenos when new tapes are being created.  The detail and implementation forms must be sent to Temenos.  Upon checking this information, a license and maintenance code will be generated to enable the system generation program to be run. */
