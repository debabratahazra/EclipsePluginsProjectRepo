	/* Encompassed within the Funds Transfer Module is a fully operational Inward Bulk Standing Orders application. In many respects it is similar to the Standing Order application, except of course it allows incoming payments to be bulked together for different debitors to one account, i.e. one credit, lots of debits.
This will allow the user to load standing orders as Fixed Payments with a known amount.
The application may be run on-line or as an end-of-day process.  In order to run the Inward Bulk Standing Orders on-line, there is a separate application called SINGLE.INWARD.BULK. For more details refer to the relevant help text.
The FT.BULK.CREDIT file has the standard 3 versions:
'Live' file            'Unauthorised' file            'History' file. */

		/* Represents the ID by which each Inward Bulk Standing Order is uniquely identified.
The ID can be Account No followed by automatically generated sequence or Account no with date separated by "-" and a automatically generated sequence.
If the Id is given with a a date, then it will be consider as a Single Payment Type and the id date will be defaulted to single payment date and ID date has to be greater than today.
For a frequency based Bulk Standing order, the id has to be created with account no followed by automatically generated sequence number.
Hence for a same date using the sequence no, more than one Bulk Standing Orders can be created.
When the User wants to change an existing Inward Bulk Standing Order, it will be necessary to enter the complete reference number i.e. the Account Number and the date separated by a - (minus sign).
Validation Rules

2-30 type A (alphanumeric) characters as follows: - The first part of the     ID will identify the Account Number for which the User wants to define     Inward Bulk Standing Order instructions( Input Mandatory). The format is the     Standard numeric Account number or 3-10 character Account Mnemonic     (uppercase alphanumeric or '.') - type MNE - The second part of the ID will     be separated from the Account Number by a '-' and will be a date. (Optional     input). The third part of ID is automatic generated sequence number given by     the system.
If Date is entered as a part of ID, Id date defaulted as the Single payment     date and ID date has to be greater than today.
For the Change function the User will need to enter the complete key     including the date itself, as long as it is greater than or equal to     today's. */

You can combine 1 or 2 date operations, always based on the frequency date, each operation being "+" or "-", followed by a number of days and followed by "C" or "W", meaning calendar or working days.
"+" and "C" are taken by default.
If number alone entered then it will be converted into valid date.
If nothing is entered here, default calculation will be done through the Funds Transfer calculation rules, depending on the payment method.
Examples :
"+01C-01W" which means "Last working day before the processing date"
"-02C" means processing date less 2 calendar days,
"01"  entered when the system month/ year is Jan/2001, then it will convert to 01012001
and so on ...
Validation Rules

Up to 8 type ANY (alphanumeric) characters. "+" and     "C" are optional, and zeros will be added if needed. Example :     "1-1W" will be taken as "+01C-01W". Optional input,     blank means default FT calculation.
