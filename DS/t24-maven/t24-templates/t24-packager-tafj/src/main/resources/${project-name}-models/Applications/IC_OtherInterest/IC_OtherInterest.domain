This field stores the highest number of links (or levels) between this account and the top of the ICA hierarchies it has been a member of.
An ICA hierarchy consists of linked groups of accounts, each group has a main account to which sub accounts are linked.
A main account in one group can be a sub account in another group.
The main account of the highest level group is the top account.
In order to calculate ICA group interest the combined balances of all in the group are used.
If a group contains sub accounts which are themselves main accounts of lower level groups then group interest is calculated using the group balances of the lower level group of which the sub account is the main account rather than the balance of the sub account itself.
The balances of each group are combined into special ACCT.ACTIVITY records, which contain the combined balances for the whole group.
This scenario requires that the lowest level groups in the hierarchy are processed first so that their combined balances are available for the group interest calculations of the higher level groups.
The structure of the ICA hierarchy can also change with time as group links can be moved from one level to another or even to different hierarchies.
The MAX.PROC.LEVEL field is used to store the lowest level that a group has been, (in fact the highest number of links between it and the top of a hierarchy) in order that the ICA group interest processing takes place in the correct order.

This "live" (system updated) file contains all details relevant to an ICA (Interest compensation Account hierarchy) group.

It is updated in two ways

On account authorisation when changes are made to the structure of this ICA group, i.e. changing the link to a higher level ICA group or changing links from sub accounts linked to this group
On capitalisation of the account which is the leader of the group (the record key), details of the interest calculation and ICA interest distribution are stored.
The ICA.GROUP.HISTORY file is identical to this file except that the key is appended with the capitalisation date. It is updated each time the main account is capitalised.
Capitalisation correction processing will also cause this file to be updated.
ICA.GROUP.DETAIL and ICA.GROUP.HISTORY provide a convenient way to show all relevant data for a group.
The T24 system files, which provide the financial data for these ICA group files are described below.
Details of ICA interest calculations and interest distribution are stored in the STMT.ACCT.XX (CR, CR2, DR, and DR2) files.
Details of ICA account balances are store in the ACCT.ACTIVITY file.
The keys to these files are as follows.

Main account calculation (using the combined balances of all accounts in the group)

MAIN.ACCOUNT*-DATE
Sub account calculation for partial member (using only the balances for the periods when the sub account was a group member)

MAIN.ACCOUNT*SUB.ACCOUNT-DATE
NB. If a sub account is also a main account then the relevant ICA type ACCT.ACTIVITY records will be used to calculate balances.
The date for the ACCT.ACTIVITY file is of the YYYYMM type.
The date to the STMT.ACCT.XX file is of the YYYYMMDD type.
If capitalisation corrections are applied then the CORR.ACCT.XX will also be updated accordingly.

An ICA hierarchy consists of linked groups of accounts, each group has a main account to which sub accounts are linked.

The main account of the highest level group is the top account.
In order to calculate ICA group interest the combined balances of all in the group are used.

The balances of each group are combined into special ACCT.ACTIVITY records, which contain the combined balances for the whole group.
This scenario requires that the lowest level groups in the hierarchy are processed first so that their combined balances are available for the group interest calculations of the higher level groups.

An ICA hierarchy consists of linked groups of accounts, each group has a main account to which sub accounts are linked.
A main account in one group can be a sub account in another group.
The main account of the highest level group is the top account.
In order to calculate ICA group interest the combined balances of all in the group are used.
If a group contains sub accounts which are themselves main accounts of lower level groups then group interest is calculated using the group balances of the lower level group of which the sub account is the main account rather than the balance of the sub account itself.
The balances of each group are combined into special ACCT.ACTIVITY records, which contain the combined balances for the whole group.
This scenario requires that the lowest level groups in the hierarchy are processed first so that their combined balances are available for the group interest calculations of the higher level groups.
The structure of the ICA hierarchy can also change with time as group links can be moved from one level to another or even to different hierarchies.

This "live" (system updated) file contains all details relevant to an ICA (Interest compensation Account hierarchy) group.

It is updated in two ways

On account authorisation when changes are made to the structure of this ICA group, i.e. changing the link to a higher level ICA group or changing links from sub accounts linked to this group
On capitalisation of the account which is the leader of the group (the record key), details of the interest calculation and ICA interest distribution are stored.
The ICA.GROUP.HISTORY file is identical to this file except that the key is appended with the capitalisation date. It is updated each time the main account is capitalised.
Capitalisation correction processing will also cause this file to be updated.
ICA.GROUP.DETAIL and ICA.GROUP.HISTORY provide a convenient way to show all relevant data for a group.
The T24 system files, which provide the financial data for these ICA group files are described below.
Details of ICA interest calculations and interest distribution are stored in the STMT.ACCT.XX (CR, CR2, DR, and DR2) files.
Details of ICA account balances are store in the ACCT.ACTIVITY file.
The keys to these files are as follows.

Main account calculation (using the combined balances of all accounts in the group)

MAIN.ACCOUNT*-DATE
Sub account calculation for partial member (using only the balances for the periods when the sub account was a group member)

MAIN.ACCOUNT*SUB.ACCOUNT-DATE
NB. If a sub account is also a main account then the relevant ICA type ACCT.ACTIVITY records will be used to calculate balances.
The date for the ACCT.ACTIVITY file is of the YYYYMM type.
The date to the STMT.ACCT.XX file is of the YYYYMMDD type.
If capitalisation corrections are applied then the CORR.ACCT.XX will also be updated accordingly.

This scenario requires that the lowest level groups in the hierarchy are processed first so that their combined balances are available for the group interest calculations of the higher level groups.

This table is used in premium processing calculation where a 5 year history is required to provide data for calculations. In some cases theis data may go back to before system take on. It has the same structure as ACCT.ACTIVITY the main provider of data for interest and charges calculations.

Details are held in separate records for each Account for each month in which there has been any Activity over the Account or in which the Value Dated Balance changes.

The details held in this file for the calculation of interest include Value Dated Balances and total Debit and Credit Turnover for each Value Date.

The details held for the calculation of charges include the total number of entries with each different Transaction Code processed during the month, and the total value of the entries with each Transaction Code. These details are held in the record for the month in which the entries are processed, regardless of the Value Dates of the entries.

The Value Dated Balances are also used for the calculation of Balance Requirement charges and for determining whether a high enough Balance has been maintained for waiving charges and for calculating Credit interest to offset charges.

VALUE DATED BALANCES

Interest is calculated on Value Dated Balances. All entries over an Account are considered to have a Value Date, which is the date on which the entry affects the (value dated) balance for interest purposes.

If no Value Date is entered in a transaction, it may be added automatically by the system, depending on rules specified in the Transaction Code table (TRANSACTION), or rules specified in the application which generated the transaction (e.g.Money Market).

If no Value Date has been entered or generated in an entry, a default of the Booking Date is assumed, i.e. the entry is considered to affect the balance for interest purposes on the same day as it is processed.

END OF DAY PROCESSING

This file is updated during the end of day process EOD.ACCT.ACTIVITY with the details of every entry which has been generated during the day and also during the end of day Capitalisation processes, EOD.CAPITALIS.CORR and (unless next day posting is specified in the Account Accrual table) EOD.CAPITALISATION.

A new Account Activity record is generated every time an entry is encountered with a Value Date or Booking Date in a month in which the Account has not previously had any entries.

If an entry has a Value Date in a different month from the Booking Date, at least 2 Account Activity records are updated, one containing the Value Dated Balances for interest purposes, the other containing the numbers and amounts of transactions for charges purposes.

If an entry has a Value Date earlier than entries which have previously been processed for the same Account, all subsequent Value Dated Balances are updated. This may involve updating several Account Activity records.

Only the See, Print and List functions may be used in this Application. */
