		/* Default spread to be applied to loan type contracts for a specific customer or group. The value can be positive or negative as this value can be used to increase or decrease the end user rate.

In usage the bank may wish to set a floating rate record to be the generally available rate for customer loans and use the values here to soften the rates by deducting a small amount, thereby reducing the rate to the user. However, it is just as valid to use the standard rate record as the base rate and add a spread to this to provide client rates.

Whichever is used the system will work out the end spread as follows:

BASIC.INTEREST + LD.TXN.TYPE.CONDITION(INTEREST.SPREAD) + LD.GROUP.CONDITION(INT.SPREAD.LOAN)

Example 1: Say in LD.TXN.TYPE.CONDITION the category 21050 stipulates an interest key for all USD contracts. This key corresponds to a rate of 5% in the BASIC.INTEREST table. If a particular group (say GRPA) has an entry of 0.5 in the INT.SPREAD.LOAN field in LD.GROUP.CONDITION, this would mean that a USD loan taken by a customer falling in GRPA would be at a defaulted rate of 5.5% (5% +0.5%).

Example 2: Say in LD.TXN.TYPE.CONDITION the category 21051 stipulates an interest key for all USD contracts and a spread of 0.75%. This key corresponds to a rate of 5% in the BASIC.INTEREST table so general loans are going to get 5.75% interest. If a particular group (say GRPB) has an entry of -0.5 in the INT.SPREAD.LOAN field in LD.GROUP.CONDITION, this would mean that a USD loan given to a customer falling in GRPA would be at a defaulted rate of 5.25% (5% +0.75% -0.5%), thereby getting a lower rate than the general loans.

In usage the bank may wish to set a floating rate record to be the generally available rate for customer deposits and use the values here to soften the rates by adding a premium, thereby increasing the rate to the user. However, it is just as valid to use the standard rate record as the base rate and deduct a spread from this to provide client rates.

Whichever is used the system will work out the end spread as follows:

Example 1: Say in LD.TXN.TYPE.CONDITION the category 21006 stipulates an interest key for all USD contracts. This key corresponds to a rate of 5% in the BASIC.INTEREST table. If a particular group (say GRPA) has an entry of 0.5 in the INT.SPREAD.DEP field in LD.GROUP.CONDITION, this would mean that a USD deposit taken from a customer falling in GRPA would be at a defaulted rate of 5.5% (5%+0.5%).

Example 2: Say in LD.TXN.TYPE.CONDITION the category 21005 stipulates an interest key for all USD contracts and a negative spread of 0.75%. This key corresponds to a rate of 5% in the BASIC.INTEREST table so general deposits are going to get 4.25% interest. If a particular group (say GRPB) has an entry of 0.5 in the INT.SPREAD.DEP field in LD.GROUP.CONDITION, this would mean that a USD deposit taken from a customer falling in GRPA would be at a defaulted rate of 4.75% (5% -0.75% +0.5%), thereby getting a better rate than the general deposits.

First a new market has to be created in CURRENCY.MARKET. The default exchange rate that is to be used for settlement is input in the respective currency tables under the specific market chosen.

Based on the value in SETTLEMENT.MARKET and CONVERSION.TYPE (which may be BUY/SELL/MID) in the deal, the appropriate rate is used for conversion purposes during EOD.


If the user has input a rate in EV.APPL.RATE in SETTLEMENT.RATES table for a particular deal, then this rate is considered for conversion. Should there be no input in EV.APPL.RATE for the deal for the scheduled date, the rate in the CURRENCY table for the CURRENCY.MARKET and CONVERSION.TYPE defined in the deal is used for conversion.
