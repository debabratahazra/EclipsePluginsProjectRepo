	/* The Commercial Loans and Deposits Module automates the control,
administration, accounting and management information requirements
of both pre and post maturity processing on a Bank's Portfolio.
A wide range of products are catered for and these may be classified
into five generic groups:-
A Commercial Loan   An asset product which provides an
extensive range of processing in relation                     to the
physical extension of credit to a                     borrower.
A Commercial DepositA liability product which provides an
extensive range of processing facilities.
A Commitment        A product type which controls those
instances where a contractual obligation                     to lend
exists and/or the bank wishes to                     levy commitment
fees based on usage etc.
A Sundry Deposit    A miscellaneous item due to a customer.
A Sundry Loan       A miscellaneous item due from a                     customer.
The module has been designed to be as flexible as possible in
managing the various products it covers, and automating as many
functions as one would encounter in the typical Commercial Loans and
Deposits Department of a Bank.
It provides a comprehensive set of on-line enquiry facilities,
operational, marketing and management reports which obviate the need
for loan ledger cards and other types of documentation traditionally
maintained manually.
The system can if required process a transaction through its life
cycle without any intervention from the user, alternatively, the
user can opt for full manual control.
All processing results in the automatic generation of payments,
billings, chasers, contract/rate amendment documentation etc.
The Bank has full control over the parameters associated with the
life cycle of a transaction  eg indicating the number of days after
an event when the transaction is considered to be a past due
obligation.  Such parameters are specified in tables which can be
amended at any time.
The main features of the module can be described as follows:-
Multi-Currency drawdown or liquidation.
Contracts can be denominated in a currency different from that of the
drawdown or liquidation accounts. Full control is always maintained
in terms of Negotiable, User input or Default Exchange rates
applicable to the transaction.
Fixed Maturity and Call/Notice.
The system processes both Fixed date and Call/Notice type transactions.
Interest bearing and discounted loans and deposits.
Both interest bearing and discounted contracts can be processed.
These can be either single or multiple period transactions.
Five days basis upon which interest/commission will be calculated.
Five days basis currently exist within the system, these are as follows:-
360/360           366/360           360/365           366/365
Special basis.
Five different interest types.
The following interest types are employed offering a wide range of
options for the way in which a bank will structure the interest
component on a transaction:-
Fixed
Floating                      Base rate linked
Periodic Automatic type       Automatic Libor linked
Periodic Manual type          manual Libor linked
Periodic Straight type        manual libor linked
Automatic or fully manual scheduling facilities for all the financial
components. The scheduling facilities of the system accomodate
either automatic or manual processing for single or multiple period
transactions. Schedules can be defined for each of the following components:-
Principal repayments Interest payments Commission
payments Fee collections Revision rates
Margin rates Diary events. Schedules are defined, on the
input date for the appropriate events occuring during a contracts
life. They may be changed individually, or collectively redefined at
any point should the need arise.
The schedule dates can be generated automatically by the system where
they form part of a regular plan or can be input individually by the
user when they result in irregular periods. Any combination of
system generated and user input schedules is allowed.
Automatic or manual liquidation facilities.
The user can specify whether the system should automatically
liquidate amounts due on each due date or await user intervention to
manually effect the process.
A further option exists which allows the liquidation of principal to
be manual while all other components such as interest, commission,
fees etc are automatically processed by the system.
Local and Withholding Taxation.
The module caters for the processing of local or withholding tax.
Local tax is computed on any or all of the following components:-
Principal Interest Commission
Withholding tax on the other hand is computed solely on the interest
component. The undermentioned four methods are employed and the
system provides comprehensive facilities to track the Banks
liability, the status in relation to outstanding receipts etc.
"CN"  Customer Net "CG"  Customer Gross
"BN"  Bank Net "BG"  Bank Gross
Full post event and post maturity processing.
Once an event has fallen due the user has the option of manually
controlling the status, or allowing the system to control the status
in accordance with parameters present on certain tables.
Such parameters are specified by the Bank when implementating the
system, they can however be changed at any time.
The sequence of steps followed are as followed:-
PAST DUE OBLIGATION "PDO" STATUS.
Penalty accruals commence on either a financial or
memorandum basis.
NON ACCRUAL BASIS "NAB" STATUS.
All financial accruals cease.   Memorandum accruals continue.
Interest, commission, fees etc, are written off or
capitalised dependending on the Banks implementation decisions.
WRITE OFF "WOF" STATUS.
The principal is written off and the contract is archived.
Revolving and non revolving Commitments.
The Commitment contract controls contractually committed lines and
facilitates the accrual of commitment fees based on the original or
unused amount of the contract.
A Commitment can be either revolving or non revolving in nature. A
revolving commitment results in the reinstating of the drawdown
amount once it has been successfully liquidated. A non revolving
Commitment is a reducing entity only.
Automatic production of payment instructions plus all documentation.
Documentation is produced automatically for each and every event
indicated by the user at implementation time; likewise payment
instructions are generated when appropriate.
Once generated by the Loans And Deposits Module the records are
handed off to the T24 Delivery System for subsequent processing.
Comprehensive enquiry and reporting facilities.
A full range of on-line enquiries and regular reports is provided.
These have been designed to obviate traditional manual recording
systems. These facilities will prove complimentary to back-office
department, account officer, treasurer and the management of the bank.
The on line enquiries available are:-
Contracts Summary Display           Amounts Outstanding
Overdue Amounts           Repayment History           Events By
Transaction Date           Transaction Schedules           Current

states whether the total amount unused is to be charged at a
single rate (level),or whether the amount is split into
several different bands,and each 'band' charged at
a different rate.

Level type
Will charge interest on a 'level' method e.g. :
AMT 1M rate 1/4 %  = 0-1M charge 1/4 %           AMT 4M rate
1/2 %  = 1-4M charge 1/2 %           AMT 5M rate 3/4 %  =
4-5M charge 3/4 %
So, 3M unused would be charged at 1/2 %, but if 4M is unused,
the whole amount would be charged at 3/4 %.

Banded type
Will charge interest on a banded basis, e.g.:
1M rate 1/4 % = on first 1M charge 1/4 %           4M rate
1/2/% = on next  3M charge 1/2 %           5M rate 3/4 % =
on final 1M charge 3/4 %
e.g. If 4M unused, 1M would be charged at 1/4 %, and 3M
charged at 1/2 %.
Caution : The amounts and their respective rates can be input
in any           order, however, the system will take the
largest amount as the           Available Commitment Amount.

On an interest bearing contract the commission accrues on the
face value of the contract. At maturity the value of the
contract will equal the principal value + interest + commission
On a discounted contract the commission is taken at the start
of the transaction. At maturity the value of the contract
will equal the principal value + interest only.
On a commission payable contract the commission accrues on
the face value of the contract. At maturity, or commission
scheduled payment date, the customer of the loan will be
credited with the commission amount.
The following values have been defined:
'1' = Interest bearing contracts
For a one period contract, the commission will be collected
on the maturity date.  For contracts with various commission
schedules, the commission will be collected in arrears on
the scheduled commission maturity dates.
'2' = Discounted basis contracts
The discount deducted in advance is reported as unearned
commission. The discount is accrued on a straightline basis
during the life of the contract.
For contracts with various commission schedules the
commission will be collected at the inception of each
scheduled interest period.
In this case, if no payment is received, the user will always
liquidate the next discounted interest due against a
receivable or transit account.
After final maturity, the system will automatically change
the 'discounted' payment type to 'interest
bearing' payment type.
Discounted contracts will be converted to interest bearing if
principal is outstanding on the maturity/event date. Any
future accruals will be handled on an interest bearing basis
however the current portion will remain on a discounted basis.

Where the following 9 items are supplied by the system:
111 =  Contract number.          222 =  Currency mnemonic.
333 =  Amount of contract. (or Principal to be re-defined
inclusive of forward dated principal increases)          444
=  Start date of contract.          555 =  Maturity date of
contract.          666 =  Payment method and category.
777 =  Customer mnemonic.          888 =  Interest rate type
and interest basis.          999 =  Commission rate type and
commission calculation method.
The following information has to be input by the user:
A1  = forward/backward key  where:                     1 =
forward                     2 = backward
3 = fwd same month                     4 = not automatic(default)
When the user wishes the system to generate a series of
schedules        automatically this code will indicate the
response if the derived        day is a non-working day.
If the derived day is a non working day the system response
will        be:
1 = forward The system will go forward to the next working day.
2 = backward The system will go backward to the last working day.
3 = fwd same month The system will go forward to the next
working            day provided it is within the same month.
If it is not within            the same month the system
will go backward.
4 = not automatic The user must specify each and every event
date.            If non-working days are specified the
system will prompt for            overrides.
B1  = base date key    where:                 1 = base
2 = previous                 3 = not automatic (default)
This code indicates to the system how the future event dates
are to       be computed.
1 = base The system will use the first scheduled date entered
to           compute the subsequent event date(s).
2 = previous The system will use the last computed schedule
date in           order to compute the subsequent event date.
3 = not automatic The user will enter each and every event
date.           This option is only valid if the
forward/backward key = 4 not           automatic.
C1  = schedule type i.e.                 "P" =
principal                 "I" = interest
"C" = commission                 "R" =
revision                 "M" = margin
"F" = fees                 "D" = diary
"S" = settlement (system)
"A" = advice (system)
Not all codes are allowed ie Commitments cannot have
principal       repayment or margin amendments. Combinations
are allowed where the       schedule is valid for the
components ie principal and interest.
C2  = schedule event date ie .                 DDMMM
DDMMMYY                 DDMMMYYYY                 DDMMYY
DDMMM                 DDMM                 YYYYMMDD                 DD
This is the end date of the first period and the starting
date for       the next/all subsequent events.
C3  = amount of schedule or diary narrative.
This field indicates the amount of an action or the
appropriate       diary narrative. An amount can be up to 14
characters plus a decimal       point; diary narrative is 35
characters per line.
C4  = the revision rate.
This relates to the revision rate for either the interest or
margin       components.
C5  = charge code.
A valid charge code as defined on the CHARGES table. This
field       relates to fees and the fee currency will always
be in the currency       of the contract.
C6  = number of scheduled events to occur.
This field indicates the number of subsequent scheduled
events that       are to occur.
C7  = frequency of the form                 nnnD =
daily                 nnnM =        monthly
nnnQ =        Quarterly                 nnnS =        semi
annually                 nnnA =        annually
with  nnn  =        1 to 999 and indicates the period
between schedule event i.e. 4 D =
every four days.
Considerations for Syndications.       When the user is
"AGENT" and a participant the screen definition
will relate to the participating agents share (type 00).
The       remainder of the syndicate detail will be computed
based on the       percentages indicated on the contract.
When the user is "AGENT" and not a participant the
screen       definition relates to the syndicate definition
as a whole (type 99).

In the case of bill rediscounting transactions this field is
system written by the amount of profit/loss on the
transaction. The calculation of such profit/loss would
depend on two factors:

(A) Setting of

(i) If in the discount transaction, straight discount method
has been used (ie)YIELD.METHOD = NO , then the following
formula would be used for arriving at the profit/loss at the
time of rediscounting.

Profit from re-discounting = Bill Amount (Face Value) *
(Discount Rate  Re-discount Rate) * No. Days left to
maturity from rediscounting date

Note: If the YIELD.METHOD is set to YES in the rediscount
transaction, (ie) a discount to yield rate has been used,
the effective straight rediscount rate would be derived and
used in the above formula. The straight rediscount rate is
to be arrived at as follows:

Straight re-discount rate
=

Where d: number of days according to the base in the
rediscount transaction

(ii) If in the discount transaction, a discount to yield rate
has been used, (ie)

Profit from re-discounting = (Original Bill Transaction
Amount (from first transaction)* yield Rate (from first
transaction)  Bill Transaction amount (from re-discount
transaction) * yield rate (from re-discount
transaction))*number of days to maturity from rediscounting
transaction /number of days in year according to common base.

Note: If the YIELD.METHOD is set to NO in the rediscount
transaction, (ie) a straight discount rate has been used,
the corresponding discount to yield rate would be derived
and used in the above formula. This rate is to be arrived at
as follows:

Discount to yield rate =

Where d: number of days according to the base in the
rediscount transaction

(B) The setting of field INTEREST.BASIS in the discount and
rediscount transactions

It may happen that the INTEREST.BASIS used for the rediscount
transaction is different from that in the discount
transaction. In such cases, the interest rate used in the
rediscount transaction is to be adjusted for the base in the
discount transaction. The formula to be used is given below

r = r *

where:

r - interest rate according to the base in discount transaction

r - interest rate according to the base in the re-discounting transaction

d  number of days according to the base in the rediscount transaction

d  number of days according to the base in discount transaction

D  number of days in year according to the base of rediscount transaction

Details of individual trade bills are held in the application BILL.REGISTER.
In order to discount or rediscount a bill or bundle of bills
the key should be entered in this field. This will default
the following information:
AMOUNT The value of the Bill from BILL REGISTER CUSTOMER The
DRAWEE of the Bill from BILL.REGISTER CURRENCY The CURRENCY
of the Bill from BILL.REGISTER MATURITY.DATE The
MATURITY.DATE of the Bill from BILL.REGISTER
consequently operations on bundles of bills can only be
applied where the customer, currency and maturity date are
the same.
DISCOUNT of Bills
Bills can only be discounted when they have first been
ACCEPTED. A Bill is accepted using the MD.DEAL module, once
accepted the status in the BILL.REGISTER is set to ACCEPTED.
When a bill is discounted the bank takes ownership of the
Bill in return for payment of an amount which will be
greater the closer to the maturity of the Bill. A discount
rate is quoted which is used to calculate the amount to be
paid. The amount to be paid is:
Bill Amount - (Bill Amount * Discount Rate * No Days)
where: Bill Amount is held in BILL.REGISTER, No.Days is the
number of days between value date and maturity date.
A Bill Discount transaction should therefore entered in the
Loans and Deposits application as a Discounted Loan using
the following fields:
INT.PAYMT.METHOD = 2 INTEREST.RATE = Discount Rate
RE-DISCOUNT of Bills
Bills can only be re-discounted when they have already been
DISCOUNTED. A Bill is discounted as described above, ince
discounted the status of the BILL.REGISTER record is set to DISCOUNTED.
When a Bill is re-discounted the bank sells the Bill on in
return for an amount which will be greater the closer to the
maturity date of the Bill. A re-discount rate is quoted
which is used to calculate the amount to receive. The amount
to be received can be calculated as:
Bill Amount - (Bill Amount * Re-discount Rate * No Days)
Once Bills are re-discounted they are no longer owned by the
bank and should not appear in the books. The re-discount
transaction is therefore entered as a deposit to offset the
original discount. Since the discount and re-discount are
unlikely to take place at the same rate, a profit or loss
will be made on the rediscount transaction which should be
realised immediately.
In order to offset the discount transaction an amount is
calculated based on the original discount rate for the
remaining life of the Bill. This amount is held in the
DRAWDOWN.ISSUE.PRC field for all bills, the resulting
ISSUE.PL.AMOUNT should be accrued over the remaining life of
the contract to offset the discount accrual.
The remaining profit or loss from the re-discount is stored
in the CHRG.AMNT fields (see BILL.REDISC.RATE for details).
The sum of the DRAWDOWN.ISSUE.PRC and CHRG.AMNT fields is
the total amount to be received.
The following fields should be entered for a re-discount:
INT.PAYMT.METHOD = 2 INTEREST.RATE = 0 BILL.REDISC.RATE =
Rediscount Rate
Validation Rules

proceeds may be credited/debited to an account denominated
in another currency. Charges that are collected may have any
currency account for liquidation purposes. In case of
