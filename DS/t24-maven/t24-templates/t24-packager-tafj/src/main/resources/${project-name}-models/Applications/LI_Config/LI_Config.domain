	/* The Limit System is designed to monitor the availability and utilisation of Limits.  Customer Limits are monitored in real-time.  Back end reports are used to monitor Limits for Commodities, Countries, Country Groups and Currencies.  The design of the System is such that the definition of the simplest through to the most complex of Limits is catered for.
Limit Reference Table
A Limit Reference is a numeric code which defines a type of Limit.  For those cases where it may be necessary to sub-divide a Limit Reference, a hierarchy can be defined.  A hierarchy can consist of up to 3 levels i.e. Global Limit, Product Limit and Sub product Limit.
To define the Application which utilises a Limit Reference, the user will specify his own parameters and Limit checking conditions on the LIMIT.PARAMETER table.
REDUCING LIMIT field indicates whether or not a Limit is a Reducing Limit.  In other words, whether the Limit is Revolving or Non-Revolving.  A reducing or non-revolving Limit does not have its value restored when a Transaction is repaid.
Limit Parameter
Within this file are defined parameters which determine the way in which the Limit system operates.  These are as follows:
1.         An indicator to specify whether Foreign Exchange            contracts are, or are not, to be netted before Limit            comparison.
2.         A 'number of days' to define how many days prior to            Limit Expiry Date and Limit Review Date the approach of            these events is to be reported.
3.         A date and cycle to indicate when the first revaluation            will occur and at what frequency thereafter.
4.         A date and cycle to indicate when a full Central Liability            report (including those Liability numbers which did not            move) need to be produced in the back-end process.
5.         A number of days (administrative extension days) which            defines the maximum number of days by which the            expiry date of a limit can be "administratively" extended            before a new expiry date is reassigned to the limit.
6.         The Limit product definition according to the specific            requirements of the Bank.  The most important feature            of this file is that it allows the user, for each Financial            Application, to define the precise rules applicable to his            environment.  In this way, the Limit verification process            can be established by the user according to his own set            of rules without any program maintenance.
Limits
All Customer Limits are defined at the Liability Number level.  The simplest case is where a Limit, such as an Advance in Current Account is defined for a Liability number.
The Country of Risk of each Limit may be added to each Limit record. It is entered as a 2 character Country Code.  If it is not entered, the Country of Residence, from the Customer record of the Liability Number, is taken as default.
The Commodity (or Industry) in which the user of the Limit is involved, may be added to each Limit record. This is entered as a four character Commodity Code. If it is not entered, the Industry Code, from the Customer record of the Liability Number, is taken as default.
A Limit at the top level of the structure can be defined as a secured Limit. This Limit can then be defined as a 'variable' or a 'fixed' Limit. Details of the Collateral securing the Limit are entered in the T24 Collateral Module. The system will automatically maintain details of the current value of the supporting Collateral. In the case of a variable Limit, this information is used by the system to automatically adjust the on-line limit amount whenever the value of the underlying Collateral changes. In the case of a fixed limit, the same information about the underlying Collateral is maintained, but the on-line limit amount is never adjusted. This facility is not available for sub-limits within a credit line.
For Limits which have an associated Repayment schedule (for instance Term Loans), details of that schedule may be input.  Input of this information is optional.
It should be noted that all information held concerning Repayment Schedules is held for information purposes only.  The System makes no further use of the information.
To cater for the special requirements of Foreign Exchange, an additional field  - CLEAN RISK AMT is included.  The CLEAN RISK AMT is the maximum amount of Foreign Exchange contracts which can mature on a single maturity date.
Whenever a Limit is stated in one currency and transactions occur in other currencies, the Limit System will convert from the currency of the transaction to the currency of the Limit before any utilisation comparison is made.  This is achieved by using the latest available on-line, real-time, middle exchange rate from the currency table. For the Foreign Exchange application it is always the bought currency and amount which will be converted to the currency of the Limit.
An installation time option is whether gross or net Foreign Exchange transaction values are to be compared with Limits.
Except for Limits tied to the ACCOUNT module, the ON LINE LIMIT amount can be associated with a Time Code.  The purpose of this is to allow the specification of periods of time (measured in days), during which maximum aggregate transaction amounts must mature.
At the time of input of a transaction (Foreign Exchange, Letters of Credit etc.), the Limit System is asked for information concerning the existence and availability of a Limit.  If more than one Limit of the same type exists for the same customer (e.g. Product Limit & Global Limit), the Application will automatically and exclusively update the Product Limit except if the Global Limit reference has been input at transaction level.  If 2 Global lines exist for the same customer with the same Limit Type, the Application will update the Global Limit with the lowest key number except if overridden by an input at transaction level.
Occasionally, the required Limit does not exist or is already fully utilised.  If it does not exist, the User must make a decision as to whether or not to generate a default Limit.  If the transaction will cause an excess, the User must decide whether the excess is to be allowed.
When the existence of a Limit has been established and any necessary overrides have been obtained, the Limit utilisation is updated.  At the time of maturity of a transaction, the Limit System relies upon the Application to provide notification of the event, in order to reset the utilisation figure.
Suballocations
Suballocations can be defined as the transfer of an amount to or from a Limit.  A Transfer from a Limit is known as a Suballocation Given and has the effect of reducing the available value of the Limit.  A transfer to a Limit is a Suballocation received and has the effect of increasing the available value of a Limit.  They are input to the Limit System via Application LIMIT.SUB.ALLOC.
Group Limits
Group Limits can be specified for Countries, Country Groups, Currencies, Commodity groups and Commodities.  Group Limit information is captured on-line.  Information about outstandings to be tracked under Group Limits is captured during the on-line day.  Each night, this information is collated and reports are prepared.   Collated information about the overnight position is available during the following on-line day.
Reporting
The overnight reports produced by the System, are as follows:-
General Exception            Limits Approaching Review Date            Limits Approaching Expiry Date            Expired Limits            Moved Liability numbers            Full Central Liability Ledger Report            Country Limit Excesses            Commodity Excesses            Currency Limit Excesses
Limits in excess will be shown together with overdrawn accounts in a separate report (OVERDRAFT AND EXCESS REPORT) produced on a daily basis within the wide back-end.
Enquiries
Comprehensive enquiry facilities allow  the user to monitor on line and on a real time basis Liability and Customer exposure globally or at individual credit line level. */

The Internal Amount will often be greater than the amount advised to the Customer. This is especially the case when dealing with organisations with whom additional business is being sought. If business is agreed, the bank would not want a delay to occur due to the credit approval process. For this reason, Limits may be approved for the level of business which it is being aimed for rather than the level which is being done. Indeed, it will sometimes happen that Limits are approved when no business is being done. An example of this might be the approval of an FX Limit for a Customer who currently only has a Loan.

		/* Indicates, for a secured limit, whether the ONLINE LIMIT is a fixed or a variable amount.
A value in this field indicates that the limit is secured. The underlying collateral should be recorded in the T24 Collateral Module.
The system recognises two types of secured limit. A variable limit is one for which the system automatically allocates the value of any underlying collateral against the limit and calculates the ONLINE LIMIT amount on the basis of this secured amount. A fixed limit is similar, except that the value of the ONLINE LIMIT amount is never adjusted. In other words, the secured amount belonging to a fixed limit is calculated for information purposes but not for the system's limit checking.
The rules for the calculation of the ONLINE LIMIT amount belonging to a particular limit are specified in fields 18 to 21 on the limit record.
If this field is left blank, the system treats the limit as unsecured.
of underlying collateral are only recorded at the top-level of the limit structure, not for sub-limits.
Example:
A limit is granted up to an overall maximum of GBP 100,000.00. If this faciity is unsecured (in terms of the T24 Collateral Module), the limit record appears as follows:
17 FIXED.VARIABLE.... 21 MAXIMUM.TOTAL..... 100,000.00 23. 1. 1 COLLAT.RIGHT 24. 1. 1 SECURED.AMT. 27. 1 ONLINE.LIMIT... 100,000.00
If, instead, the facility requires security, it must be indicated by the user whether the online limit is to be system-maintained (variable) or set to the full maximum total allowed and fixed at that level. The current value of this security is, in either case, indicated by the system. In this example, there is a mortgage, currently valued at GBP 80,000.00.

		/* The maximum amount of the limit which may be unsecured.
This field defines the unsecured portion of a limit. It is used when a limit is to be partially secured.
The value in this field will, if necessary, be added to the secured amount underlying the limit when the system calculates the ONLINE LIMIT amount. If there is sufficient security for the entire TOTAL MAXIMUM allowed amount of the limit, this secured amount will be taken and the unsecured amount in this field ignored. It may be the case that only a part of the MAXIMUM UNSECURED amount is required to bring the secured amount up to the MAXIMUM TOTAL.
Note: This field is not used for a limit which is wholly unsecured. Only an overall limit is specified under these circumstances (field 21, MAXIMUM TOTAL).
Example:
A limit is granted up to an overall maximum of GBP 100,000.00. The limit is secured and variable. The current value of the underlying collateral exactly equal to the overall total limit. It is made up of a mortgage, currently valued at GBP 80,000.00, plus guarantees worth GBP 20,000.00. However, the amount of any guarantees which are acceptable as collateral has been limited to GBP 10,000.00.

Defines the overall maximum allowed amount of a limit.
In the case of an unsecured limit, or a secured but fixed limit, this field also defines the ONLINE LIMIT amount which will be made available.
In the case of a variable secured limit, the MAXIMUM TOTAL defines an upper limit to the value of the ONLINE LIMIT amount. The system will calculate the ONLINE LIMIT on the basis of the available underlying security and the 'rules' for the limit (fields 18 to 20), but the result of this calculation will never exceed the value in this field.
Example:
A limit is granted up to an overall maximum of GBP 100,000.00. The limit is secured and variable. The current value of the underlying collateral exactly equal to the overall total limit. It is made up of a mortgage, currently valued at GBP 80,000.00, plus guarantees worth GBP 20,000.00. However, the amount of any guarantees which are acceptable as collateral has been limited to GBP 10,000.00. There is also GBP 5,000.00 available under the limit without security.

If the overall maximum amount which is allowed under the limit is reduced to GBP 85,000.00, the value of the underlying collateral plus the unsecured part of the limit will then exceed this MAXIMUM TOTAL. The limit record appears as follows:

17 FIXED.VARIABLE.... VARIABLE

		/* Specifies time sub-divisions of a Limit, each of which is available for a different maturity period.
The theory behind the use of this field is that the further forward the maturity date of a transaction, the greater the associated risk.  The Limit is therefore approved on the basis that the whole Limit is available for the most immediate time slice.  The amount available then decreases as the maturity time slice increases.
Example:
A Money Market line of $100 million may be sub-divided into $60 million for maturity within 30 days, $30 million within 90 days, and the remaining $10 million within 180 days.
To enter the above limit, the overall $100 million should be entered with a 'blank' time code.  The associated multi-valued fields should be expanded to enter the sub-division as follows:            TIME.CODE          COMMITTED.AMOUNT
30                  $60 million               90                  $30 million              180                  $10 million
The example above shows that the bands must be entered in ascending order.
If a transaction exceeds the specified period (in this case 180 days) and the referral message is overriden, the system will reduce the amount available in the latest band specified (180 days).
It should be noted that when a band is not fully utilised it becomes available for use at lower levels.  In the example, if only $8 million were used in the 180 day period, $32 million would be available for 90 day contracts.

Any further                 drawdown under this commitment will be treated                 in the same way.
For Non reducing Commitments (i.e. revolving),                 the inverse operation will take place when the                 customer reimburses part or all of the drawdown                 amount(s).  The field TOTAL OS will be reduced                 by the amount of the reimbursement while this                 field will be increased by the same amount.
(ii) Any commitment contract done in a currency                 different than the LIMIT CURRENCY will be                 converted at the currency table middle rate.
(iii)This amount will be subtracted from the ONLINE                 LIMIT amount when calculating the AVAILABLE                 AMOUNT (Field 32.1).

1.         An indicator to specify whether Foreign Exchange            contracts are, or are not, to be netted before Limit            comparison.
2.         A 'number of days' to define how many days prior to Limit            Expiry Date and Limit Review Date the approach of these            events is to be reported.
3.         A date and cycle to indicate when the first revaluation            will occur and at what frequency thereafter.
4.         A date and cycle to indicate when a full Central Liability            report (including those Liability numbers which did not            move) need to be produced in the back-end process.
5.         A date and cycle to indicate when the Commodity,            Country and Currency reports must be produced.
6.         A number of days (administrative extension days) which            defines the maximum number of days by which the expiry            date of a limit can be "administratively" extended before            a new expiry date is reassigned to the limit. 7.         The Limit product definition according to the specific            requirements of the Bank.  The most important feature of            this file is that it allows the user, for each Financial            Application, to define the precise rules applicable to his            environment.  In this way, the Limit verification process            can be established by the user according to his own set            of rules without any program maintenance.
8.         The product group definition which will allow the user to            specify which are the different products which in his            opinion must be part of the Commodity, Country and            Currency exposure. */

		/* Defines whether, or not, Foreign Exchange  contracts are netted before comparison with the respective Limit.
If 'no netting' is chosen, the full value of the transaction is compared with the Limit to ensure that the transaction will not cause an excess. If 'netting' is chosen, the System will net transactions in opposite sense which involve the same two currencies, which are for the same Liability Number and which mature on the same date.
For example, suppose the following two transactions are in the System:-
Buy  USD 100,000   Sell        GBP  70,000   Value   31/12/86       Sell GBP  35,000   Buy         USD  50,000   Value   31/12/86
If 'no netting' is requested, and the Limit is 150,000 US Dollars, after the first transaction, 50,000 US Dollars is available.  After the second transaction, the Limit is reduced by the US Dollar equivalent (according to the latest on-line middle rate) of 35,000 GB Pounds.  If this gives a figure of 50,000 US Dollars, the Limit availability is reduced to zero.
If 'netting' is specified, the second transaction is subtracted from the first (100,000 US Dollars minus the middle rate equivalent of 35,000 GB Pounds), giving a net equivalent value of 50,000 US Dollars. This is then subtracted from the Limit to give an available figure of 100,000 US Dollars.
It should be noted that the Limit System always uses the same side of Foreign Exchange transactions (the bought side) for all calculations. Apart from the currency, the sold side is always ignored.
Note: It is important to note that the value of this field must be defined at installation.  Once the value has been  authorised, it can only be changed through LIMIT.CHANGE.

		/* Specifies the Application for which the user wants to create specific Limit products. Only Financial Type Applications will be allowed in this field.
For all Financial Applications (eg Loans, Money Market, Accounts, Foreign Exchange etc), T24 allows the user to define the Limit products according to his own requirements. The definition of these various Limit products will be done by Application using the association of the multivalue Fields 13 to 18. Whenever Market conditions change or the Bank's management decides to reorganise their Limit control, a simple maintenance in this table will automatically allow and take care of such changes in the Limit verification process.
It is also possible to specify a suffix after the application separated by a "-" character. This will allow sub-products to be defined for a particular application, so that more than 1 limit refererence can be defined for an application.
For example the application SL.SYNDICATED.LOANS may require 2 limit references, for the underwritten portion and the agent participation. The following could be defined:
APPLICATION SL.SYNDICATED.LOANS PRODUCT NO 4000
This is the overall for the SL application and will default 4000 as the limit reference
APPLICATION SL.SYNDICATED.LOANS-UNDERWRITE PRODUCT.NO 4100
The reference 4100 will be used for undewritten limits
APPLICATION SL.SYNDICATED.LOANS-AGENT PRODUCT.NO 4200
The reference 4200 will be used for the AGENT portion.
The order for defaulting is as follows: 1 APPLICATION-suffix with specific conditions 2 APPLICATION-suffix default 3 APPLICATION with specific conditions 4 APPLICATION default
The suffix used by applications when defaulting limit references is hard coded if required. To find if an application requires a suffix consult the application documentation.
Validation Rules

Any valid Application name (1 to 25 characters) where the         PGM.TYPE has a suffic equal to '.NOH' ie that it         represents a 'Financial' application. Multivalue field         associated with Fields 14 to 18.
The Application entered in this field must be a valid         Application in PGM.FILE.
The PGM.TYPE of the Application (except ACCOUNT) must         have a suffix of '.NOH' ie it must relate to an         Application with financial figures.
At least a 'Default' definition will be mandatory for         each Application entered in this multivalue field. The         default of an Application will be recognised by the fact         that the PRODUCT NO has been entered in Field 14.1 while         the Fields 15.1.1 to 18.1.1 have been left blank.
Duplicates of the same Application name will only be         allowed when the fields 'DECIS FIELD' to 'DECISION TO '         have been defined with different values.
A suffix may be supplied separated by a "-"         character. When supplied a default condition must exist         for the suffix, as well as a definition for the         application without suffix as the overall default. */

SUB-PRODUCT#3-4 digits#1010, 1011, 410 or 411#Last 2 digits cannot both be zero##

With this structure, the user can define up to 999 different
types of Global Line, 99 different types of Product Limit
and 99 different types of Sub-product Limit.
The relation between records is hierarchical, the Global is
the higest level and a sub-product of level 9 is the lowest.

LIMIT records use both the original LIMIT.REFERENCES as well

100000 is defined witha product of say 10000. Then a LIMIT
can refer to 110000 (i.e 100000 plus 10000). Additionally
where sub-products exist under 10000 (say 1000 and 2000)
this could result in LIMIT records with references such as:

This field can contain one of three values.
The keyword PRORATA in this field indicates that the

to maturity or the length of a MATURITY.PERIOD.BAND.
For pro rata the calculation will be;
% x days to maturity / 365
with the annual period always in days.
The keyword PERIOD indicates that the calculation will be
prorata according to the time remaining to maturity or the
length of a MATURITY.PERIOD.BAND.
The pro rata calculation for the PERIOD setting will be:
% x period to maturity / period
where period is set according to the MATURITY.BAND.DEFINITION
i.e in Days (D) Weeks (W) Months(M) Years (Y) Where a period
is a fraction of a band this will be rounded up.
When the word FIXED is indicated the calculation will not be
pro rata and is calculated as a simple percentage.

relevant percentage derived for the remaining contract
period will be applied.
When PRORATA or PERIOD is used with a BANDED structure, each
percentage band falling within the remaining contract period
will be applied for the period of the that band.

Up to 9 sub product levels can be defined below the standard
sub product level. A standard sub-product can be identified
by the last two characters of the limit reference being
anything other than zeros.
Sub-product levels 1 to 9 are allowed. With 1 representing
the highest and 9 the lowest sub product levels.

Example Product & Sub-Product:

We need a Limit structure to cover generic Loans that is
sub-divided into those to Banks and those to Non-Banks. This
requires a Product and two sub-products.

We define:
5000 - product for Loans
5010 - sub-product for Loans to Banks
5020 - sub-product for Loans to Non-Banks

Example Product, Sub-Product & Sub-product levels:

We need a Limit structure to cover generic Loans that is
sub-divided into those to Banks and those to Non-Banks. Each
of these needs to be split into secured & non-secured.
The secured level also needs to be split between secured by
property; secured by cash & secured other. This requires
a Product; two sub-products, two sub-products at level 1 and
six sub-products at level 2.

We define:
6000 - product for Loans
6010 - sub-product for Loans to Banks
6011 - secured (level 1)
6012 - secured by property (level 2)
6013 - secured by cash (level 2)
6014 - secured other (level 2)
6020 - sub-product for Loans to Non-Banks
6011 - secured (level 1)
6012 - secured by property (level 2)
6013 - secured by cash (level 2)
6014 - secured other (level 2)

Visually the structure would be like: (SEE FIGURE BELOW)

As the levels can go down to level 9, a very complex
structure could be defined.

Note:
It is possible that the existing limit reference structure is
such that it is not possible to define the required levels
of sub division e.g.: - 400 defines loans at product level;
410 defines customer loans at sub-product level; 415 defines
mortgages at sub-product level.

There are not enough numbers available between 410 and 415 to
define the new sub product levels.

In this case a new structure should be defined to replace the
existing customer loans structure and LIMIT and
LIMIT.PARAMETER updated accordingly. New loans will then use
the new limit structure, and changing the limit reference on
existing loans will have the same effect.

Validation Rules

Any of the above rates will not be applicable if the LIMIT
and the transaction are both in LCY or in the same currency.
Example
In LIMIT. PARAMETER field UPDATE. RATE is Yes. The limit
reference used is 400 in which CONVERT. RATE is BUY-SEL.
CASE1
Limit XXXXXX.400.01 is in LCY (Say USD). A contract for
USD100000 is put through to hit the limit. In this case
since both limit and the transactions are in LCY there is no
conversion involved and therefore the limit outstanding will
be updated with -100000.
CASE2
A contract for GBP100000 is put through to hit the limit
given in case1. Here the transaction in GBP will be
converted to LCY which is also the limit currency, using the
first component of the CONVERT. RATE specified in the limit
reference 400 which in this case is the BUY rate of the
transaction currency. If the Buy rate for GBP is 1.50 then
the limit outstanding will be up dated by
-150000(100000*1.50) and the total outstanding  in the limit
after this transaction will be -100000-150000= -250000.
CASE3
Limit YYYYYY.400.01 is in EUR. A contract for GBP100000 is
put through to hit this limit. BUY rate of GBP=1.50 Sell
rate of EUR=1.20.In this case the transaction in GBP will be
converted to USD by using the first component of the
CONVERT. RATE which is BUY. This amount will be converted to
EUR which is the limit currency, using the second component
of the CONVERT. RATE which is SEL. So the limit outstanding
will be calculated using the formula 100000*1.50/1.20=125000(EUR)
However in a Limit structure the rate specified in the lowest
limit reference used will be taken for updating the
outstanding in the higher limits in the hierarchy.
For example Limit reference 400 has 410, 420 and 430 as a
child references.
400-CONVERT. RATE-BUY-BUY
410- CONVERT. RATE-BUY-SEL
420-CONVERT. RATE-BUY-MID
430-CONVERT. RATE-SEL-BUY
When 410 is used to hit the limit structure, only BUY-SEL
specified in 410 will be used for updating the out standings
in both 400 & 410.
When 420 is used to hit the limit structure, only BUY-MID
specified in 420 will be used for updating the out standings
in both 400 & 420.
When 430 is used to hit the limit structure, only SEL-BUY
specified in 430 will be used for updating the out standings
in both 400 & 430.
