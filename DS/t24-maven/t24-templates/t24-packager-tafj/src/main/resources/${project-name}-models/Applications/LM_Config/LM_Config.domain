	/* The LMM.INSTALL.CONDS table is a collection of parameters used by both the Money Market and Loans/Deposits systems when processing contract records.
The key to this file is a valid COMPANY.CODE.
The table consists of six major groups of conditions, each of which is further subdivided into a number of individual operating conditions. The six principal groups are:-
DAYS BEFORE A STATUS CHANGE.    (fields 1 to 8)
These fields are used by the Loans and Deposits module only.
DAYS BEFORE REPORTS.            (fields 9 to 11)
These fields are used by the Loans and Deposits module only.
FIDUCIARIES.                    (fields 22 to 25)
These fields are used by the Money Market system only.
ACCOUNTING CONDITIONS.          (fields 26 to 28)
These fields are used by the Loans and Deposits module only.
CATEGORY CODES.                 (fields 29 to 89)
The majority of these fields are used by the Loans and Deposits module only.
Those used by Money Market are the Profit and Loss Category codes for interest paid and received.
MISCELLANEOUS.                        (fields 12 to 21 and 90)
These fields define conditions such as the number of days before a contract is written to History after it has matured; what to do if an account debit requires an override during the 'off-line', and various accrual options.
The table overleaf gives a summary of those fields that are used by the Money Market Module AND/OR the Loans and Deposits Module:-

When the system transfers contracts to History after maturity according to the number of days defined in the next field, it checks to see if there are any amounts that remain outstanding, and if so, whether the local equivalent amount is greater than this Significant Amount.  If the amount outstanding is greater than this Significant Amount then the contract will not be transferred to History and an entry will be created in the Exception Report. If the amount outstanding is LESS than or EQUAL to the Significant Amount then the amount outstanding will be posted to a suspense account, the contract will be written to History, and an Exception report entry will be created stating the amount.
A contract must also comply with other user defined parameters, such as the DAYS POST MATURITY, prior to being transferred to the History file.

		/* Indicates whether interest on contracts based on floating rates, are to be accrued on a daily basis or only when a rate change occurs.
This field has an effect only when accruals as specified in fields ACC CYCLE L CCY and ACC CYCLE F CCY are set to "monthly". Setting of fields ACC CYCLE L CCY and ACC CYCLE F CCY to "daily" overrides this field.
If fields ACC CYCLE L CCY and ACC CYCLE F CCY are set to "monthly" frequency then, where interest on a contract is based on a floating rate (e.g. Base Rate) the user is allowed the alternative of instructing the system to calculate interest on a daily basis and pass accounting entries accordingly.  Alternatively, the system may be instructed to merely inspect the interest rate on a daily basis but carry out an interest accrual only when there has actually been a rate change on a contract.
The following example will clarify the significance of each of these alternatives:-
Suppose that a contract runs thus:-
Value    Day    Day    Day    Day    Day    Mat.    Date      1      2      3      4      5     Date
10%     10%    10%    11%    11%     9%      9%
A)         Input of '1' at this field will instruct the system to carry            out the interest accruals on a daily basis and pass            accounting entries accordingly. This means that on day            1 the system will calculate interest at 10% on the contract            for one day and pass the appropriate accounting entries.            Similarly, at day 2 it will again calculate interest at 10%            on the contract for one day and pass the accounting            entries. At day 3 there is a rate change to 11% and the            system will therefore calculate interest on the contract            for one day at 11% and pass entries and so on through to            maturity of the contract.
B)         Input of '2' at this field will instruct the system only to            carry out interest accruals when there has been an            actual rate change. Thus on each of days 1 and 2 the            system will merely check the interest rate on the            contract, find that the rate rate has remained at 10%            throughout, and will not therefore carry out an interest            accrual. However, at day 3 the system will check the            interest rate, find that it has moved up from 10% to 11%            and will then calculate interest on the contract for two            days at 10% and pass the appropriate accounting entries.            It will then continue to check the rate on a daily basis            until it finds that at day 5 the rate fell back from 11% to            9% when it will then accrue interest on the contract for a            further two days, but at 11% and again  pass the            appropriate accounting entries. It will continue with this            procedure until contract maturity.
Note:      If the appropriate accrual cycle field (field ACC CYCLE            L CCY or ACC CYCLE F CCY according to currency of            the contract) was set to "DAILY" then the difference            between method "1" and "2" above would not be apparent            since accruals would always be done daily. This field            only comes into effect when fields ACC CYCLE L CCY            and/or ACC CYCLE F CCY are "MONTHLY".
Validation Rules
