From this example we can see that the PD record was created through the Money Market application for the deal MM9601200015. Input of new PD transactions is not allowed as they can only be created by the system.
It is possible to create a Payment Due contract without an underlying loan contract being present using the PD.CAPTURE application. If this is the case then the Id to the file will be in the format PDPDYYDDDNNNNN, e.g. PDPD9708900023.

The transaction number can never be changed.

Only one type of process may be performed at one time of which there are four. They are MAINTENANCE, ADJUSTMENT, REPAYMENT and SCHEDULE.
Upon input to a PD contract this is the only field which allows any input. Once an operation to be performed has been input this field blocks any further input and opens up the required fields depending upon the operation. Therefore to perform another operation on the same contract, the record must be authorised or deleted, unless of course one exits using F1.
The MAINTENANCE operation is used to change contract details such as the limit reference of the PD contract, the status of individual payments due on a particular date, whether or not to net any entries across the customer's account together, or to change the customer's portfolio.
The ADJUSTMENT operation is used to adjust the outstanding payment amounts, by type, either upwards or downwards.
The REPAYMENT operation is used to for entering details when a customer wishes to repay all or part of his/her loan.
The SCHEDULE operation is used for entering scheduled events such as rate or spread changes and for the production of chaser advices.
Validation Rules
Input must be one of the following: MAINTENANCE, ADJUSTMENT, REPAYMENT, SCHEDULE.
It is not necessary to type in full the operation to be performed. If for example an adjustment is to be made, then an input of "A" will suffice.

		/* Signifies the status of the payment which was due on the date in the field PAYMENT.DTE.DUE.
This field is automatically populated when the PD contract is created or subsequently updated.
The contents of this field may be changed by using the MAINTENANCE operation.
The normal order of status changes through the life of a PD contract are that it starts off with a status of either PRE (pre-grace), or GRA (grace period), after which it becomes PDO (past due obligation) and then it finally changes to the status of NAB (non-accrual basis).
The number of days that it takes to go through these status changes is dependent on the values defined on the PD.PARAMETER record. The contents of this field may also contain the values RPD (repaid) or WOF (written off). If the WOF option is chosen, all dues under the PD contract will be written off.
It should be noted that it is not possible to change the status backwards i.e. if the present status is "PDO", then it is not possible to change it back to "GRA". It is also not possible to change the status to "RPD" as this is only done automatically by the system if the total outstanding amount due is fully repaid.
The user may also change the status of the contract to FWOF (financial write-off). Unlike WOF, where only PD dues are written off (i.e there can still be a live underlying contract), FWOF can be used only if the underlying contract has been completely liquidated (ie) the contract is entirely in PD module. Even if the FWOF option is chosen for one set of dues, it results in the entire PD contract being written off. A contract in FWOF status will continue to show the dues frozen as on the date of the FWOF.
This field is part of an associated multivalue set.
Validation Rules


3 alphabetical characters which may be "PDO", "NAB" or "WOF". (Associated multivalue field).
Input only allowed with MAINTENANCE operation.
Status may not be changed backwards, e.g. from "NAB" to "PDO".
FWOF status cannot be chosen if there is an underlying contract in CUR   status.
FWOF can be chosen only if REVERSE.PL.AT.NAB = YES and SUSPEND.INCOME =YES   in the relevant PD.PARAMETER record
Once a contract is in FWOF status, REPAYMENT, ADJUSTMENT and SCHEDULE   changes would not be permitted
If more than one payment is due, i.e. there is more than one value in the field PAYMENT.DTE.DUE, then the status of the later payment may not be in a more advanced state than the previous payment. For example if the status of the older payment is "PDO", then the status of the later payment could not be changed to "NAB". */
