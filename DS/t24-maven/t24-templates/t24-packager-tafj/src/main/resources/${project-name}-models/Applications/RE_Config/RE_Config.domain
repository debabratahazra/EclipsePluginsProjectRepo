	/* The financial reporting in T24 will use, whenever possible, a single base as source for report generation. This base is called the CENTRAL.REPORTING FILE '(CRF)'.
Account balances, principal outstanding amounts in product files and any related amount fields such as interest reserves, accrued charges, commissions, etc. held in each individual product record will be consolidated into records held on the 'CRF'. These records will be organised by source application to limit regeneration (if required and based on change in consolidation parameters) to a single or all applications.
The 'CRF' will be maintained (rather than regenerated) by updating with details of movements from each application. These movements will cover new and maturing deals, movement from Forward to Spot to Live, changes in static data. When these movements are not covered by a STATEMENT or CATEG entry record, then a SPECIAL consolidation entry is written out.
The consolidation records will, in addition to the consolidation key, hold a series of balance, total debit movement and total credit movement fields. The local currency equivalents are also held at the consolidation record level and will be revalued within the Asset and Liability revaluation process.
The details are held on two files, one for Asset and Liability and another for Profit and Loss details. This is to allow for a different key structure for the two files.
The Asset and Liability consolidation file key will be made up of four compulsory parameters and up to twelve additional parameters. The four compulsory parameters are:
- System ID e.g. AC, FX, LD, MM, BD - Currency Market - Position Type - Currency
The Profit and Loss consolidation file key will be made up of one compulsory parameter and up to twelve additional parameters. The compulsory parameter is:
System ID = PL
The file CONSOLIDATE.COND contains the details of the additional (up to twelve) variable fields to be used in the key for the consolidation records. There are  two default CONSOLIDATE.COND records, one which contains the details for the Asset and Liability consolidation file while the other contains the details for the Profit and Loss consolidation file. If it is required to redefine any variable for a  Company, it is possible to have Company specific CONSOLIDATE.COND records for both types of consolidation. The keys for default records would be ASSET&LIAB, PROFIT&LOSS and for COMPANY with ID
xxxxxxxxx, records with keys ASSET&LIAB.xxxxxxxxx and PROFIT&LOSS.xxxxxxxxx could be defined.
The additional parameters can originate from a general file (presently limited to CUSTOMER) and/or from individual system's own files. Any combination (composition) of general and specific file parameters is allowed.
It is also possible to combine parameters into groups by defining a number of specific values or a range to constitute a group (e.g. Industry Codes 1001 to 1500 become "Financial Institutions").
For Profit & Loss details it is possible to link to the Asset & Liability key and use any component from the A&L key as part of the Profit & Loss key.
The composition of a key can be redefined at any time. During the end of day process, the consolidation base will need to be regenerated by requesting the running of the appropriate batch process. In this case it might be necessary to also change the report line definitions in order to have the new key structure reflected in the report(s).
The consolidation key, at initial load or when the fields that feed the key are changed or at the regeneration of consolidation records in the CRF, will be written to the source product record. This allows efficient raising of consolidation movement entries in the daily consolidation process.
When  Company specific CONSOLIDATE.COND records are defined, then the keys of Asset and Liability  and  Profit and Loss consolidation files  would have two components for each variable parameter which is redefined in the Company specific consolidation record. The two components would be separated by '_'; the first component would be determined using  default definition of CONSOLIDATE.COND records  and the second component  for redefined variables would be determined using the Company specific definition of CONSOLIDATE.COND records. If a variable parameter is not redefined for a Company, then that variable in the consolidation file keys  would have only one value with no '_' suffixed.
While inputting values in a Company specific CONSOLIDATE.COND record,  various validations depending on the corresponding parameter in the default record is done. However, if a parameter definition in a default CONSOLIDATE.COND record  is modified, such modification would not be automatically reflected in a Company specific record, if any. It should be ensured  that the corresponding Company specific record is also suitably modified. For example, in the default CONSOLIDATE.COND record with ID "ASSET&LIAB", the field SECTOR is defined as the seventh multi-value and the field SECTOR is redefined in the record with ID "ASSET&LIAB.US0010001". If a modification is done to the default record such that the field SECTOR is now  the eight multi-value, then the record with ID "ASSET&LIAB.US0010001" should be also suitably modified such that the redefined field SECTOR is now the eight multi-value in that record.
An example of  an Asset&Liability consolidation file key  is given below to explain the formation of default and Company specific components for the variable parameters:
Key: AC.1.TR.GBP.1001..1_10.5400_001.8530_8530._8.GB.003_._._100
VariableValueExplanation
        11001The first variable parameter is not redefined at Company       level, its value is  1001 for the default definition; it is       represented by '1001'
        2NullThe second variable parameter is not defined for the       application AC  in  default as well as in   Company       specific CONSOLIDATE.COND records; it is  represented by a null value       ''.
        31_10The third  variable parameter is  redefined at       Company level, its value is  1 for the default definition and 10 for       Company specific definition; it is represented by '1_10'
        45400_001Similar to variable 3
        58530_8530Similar to variable 3
        6_8The sixth variable parameter is redefined at Company level,       it has a null value for default definition and   8 for Company       specific definition; it is represented by  '_8'.
        7GBSimilar to variable 1
        8003_The eighth variable parameter is redefined at Company level,       its value is 003  for default definition and it has a null value for       Company specific definition; it is represented by  '003_'.
        9_The nineth  variable parameter is redefined at Company       level, it has a null value for  default definition and a null value       for Company specific definition; it is represented by  '_'.
        10_100Similar to variable 6 */

		@t24:i (t24Name=CONSOLIDATE.COND, level=I, type=H, allowedFunctions="A C D E H I L P Q R S", localRefAllowed=false)
	{
		/* Identifies whether the conditions specified refer to the Asset and Liability consolidation file (ASSET&LIAB) or the profit and loss consolidation file (PROFIT&LOSS).
Default and Company specific records are allowed for both consolidation. The ID of the default records would be ASSET&LIAB and PROFIT&LOSS. The IDs of Company specific records for the Company with ID xxxxxxxxx would be ASSET&LIAB.xxxxxxxxx and PROFIT&LOSS.xxxxxxxxx.
In Company specific consolidation records,  the variables which depend on the general file 'CUSTOMER', need to be redefined  only if the Company level definition is different.  If  for a CUSTOMER variable, there is no Company level redefinition only the first component would be formed in the consolidation keys. Variables  which depend on the Application files (FILE.NAME is LOCAL) could be redefined at Company level by: Definition of the Variable Name (Field: NAME) and File Name (FIELD;FILE.NAME); Define application specific values  in the fields MULTI.VALUE.NO to CON.ON.END for all  applications, for which the Company specific component needs to be formed. If a variable is to be defined only at Company level without any default definition, then in the default consolidation record the file name of NO LOOKUP is used for the variable.
Example :
1. ID CONSOLIDATE.KEY - ASSET&LIAB (Default record)
For the ASSET&LIAB consolidation, we have supposed that we want to refer to the SECTOR and RESIDENCE code on the CUSTOMER file (general file). From the 'LOCAL' (Application) files, we have selected the CATEGORY and MATURITY fields. The field INDUSTRY would be defined only in Company specific records and in the default record it is defined with the FILE.NAME of  "NO LOOKUP".

2. ID CONSOLIDATE.KEY - ASSET&LIAB.GB0010002 (Company specific record)
For the Company GB0010002,  it is required to have a different classification for the variable SECTOR. For this purpose, a local  reference field LOCAL.SECTOR is used. Then the Company specific CONSOLIDATE.COND record for ASSET&LIAB consolidation could be defined as given below. The name of  a variable  which is redefined in a Company specific record and its position in the multi-value set should be same as  in the default CONSOLIDATE.COND record. In this case, only the 2nd variable  SECTOR needs to be  redefined. The variable INDUSTRY which is not defined in the default record (specified with FILE.NAME as NO LOOKUP) is  defined for the Company.

3. ID CONSOLIDATE.KEY - ASSET&LIAB.GB0010003 (Another Company specific record)
For the Company GB0010003, combination of values is not required for the parameter RESIDENCE and hence the variable is redefined. Similarly   for the LOCAL application ACCOUNT combination of values  is not required for the parameter CATEGORY and hence redefined.
New definition for the LOCAL   parameter CATEGORY is inserted  for the application LD. The values of the  parameter CATEGORY is repeated for the  applications MM and FOREX, since the Company specific  values  is  needed for these applications.

(iv) The value of 'REST' is used when the values other than those            entered are to be combined under one code.  When REST is not            entered, then the missing values keep their own value except            for when LOCAL.FIELD.NO contains two field numbers when value            REST must be entered.
(v) The enrichment from the file will be displayed if the record            exists.  If the record does not exist but the value is a            possible valid value, then the enrichment 'RECORD CURRENTLY            NOT ON FILE' is displayed and this is not treated as an error.            This allows for ranges to be loaded when only part of the range            is currently in use.

Input must be a possible valid value of the referenced file specified in LOCAL.FILE.NAME or be equal to REST if LOCAL.FIELD.NO contains a single field number.
Validation rules as defined in the application specified in LOCAL.FILE.NAME for the field number entered in LOCAL.FIELD.NO apply if LOCAL.FIELD.NO contains a single field number.
When fields LOCAL.START, LOCAL.END and LCL.COMBINED are set to null, aggregation will be for each individual value and if LOCAL.FIELD contains a single field number.
When LOCAL.FIELD.NO contains two date field numbers then the values allowed here are 0-999, ID-999D or 1M to 999M or REST.
When LOCAL.FIELD.NO contains a currency code and an amount field number then the values allowed here are numeric or REST.
When LOCAL.FIELD.NO contains two field numbers the values entered must be in ascending order and the last value must be REST.
When LOCAL.FIELD.NO contains two field numbers there must be at least two sets of 'conditions' entered. */

Example A:  Single Field number in LOCAL.FIELD.NO.
LOCAL.FIELD.NO is BOE code. Values on the file are BOE codes 1 to 10, 13, 14 and 18. Aggregation must be as follows:
o         Single aggregation of the values 1 to 3;
o         Combination of the values 4 to 7 into a single              aggregation;
o         Combination of the remaining values into a single              aggregation.
Input is as follows:
Field No        Field Name        Field Value ========        ==========        =========== 12.1.1          LOCAL.START       1 13.1.1          LOCAL.END         - 14.1.1          LCL.COMBINED      1 12.1.2          LOCAL.START       2 13.1.2          LOCAL.END         - 14.1.2          LCL.COMBINED      2 12.1.3          LOCAL.START       3 13.1.3          LOCAL.END         - 14.1.3          LCL.COMBINED      3 12.1.4          LOCAL.START       4 13.1.4          LOCAL.END         7 14.1.4          LCL.COMBINED      ANY VALID VALUE 12.1.5          LOCAL.START       REST 13.1.5          LOCAL.END         - 14.1.5          LCL.COMBINED      ANY VALID VALUE

Example B:
Money Market deals are to be broken down into the following pound or pound equivalents of:
-         500,000 and below    -         500,000.01 to 1,000,000    -         1,000,000.01 to 5,000,000    -         and any over 5,000,000
Then the appropriate fields would be set up as follows:
CONSOLIDATION COND
Field No        Field Name        Field Value ========        ==========        =========== 8.1             APPLICATION       MONEY MARKET 9.1             LOCAL FILE NAME   MM.MONEY.MARKET 10.1            LOCAL FIELD NAME  3/2 11.1            LOCAL CCY         GBP 12.1.1          LOCAL START       500,000 13.1.1          LOCAL END         - 14.1.1          LCL COMBINED      1 12.1.2          LOCAL START       1,000,000 13.1.2          LOCAL END         - 14.1.2          LCL COMBINED      2 12.1.3          LOCAL START       5,000,000 13.1.3          LOCAL END         - 14.1.3          LCL COMBINED      3 12.1.4          LOCAL START       REST 13.1.4          LOCAL END         - 14.1.4          LCL COMBINED      9

Example C:  Initial Time
Money Market deals are to be split as follows:
-         Those at Call -         Up to 7 Days Notice -         Up to 30 Days Notice -         Term of up to 7 days -         Term of up to 1 month (excluding those up to 7 days -         Term of up to 6 months -         Term of up to 1 year -         rest which will be any notice period greater than 30 days           and any term over 1 year.
Note:     Term is decided as the difference between the value date           and Maturity date.
The appropriate fields on CONSOLIDATE COND would be set up as follows:

Notes : (i) The details entered in fields MULTI.VALUE.NO to CON.ON.END             are only relevant for the application entered in APPLICATION.             Though the same variable component in the Consolidation Record             key can be used by more than one application, the meaning may             be different for each application.
(ii) The fields MULTI.VALUE.NO to CON.ON.END are only used for the             Asset and Liability record.  There can not be entries for             Profit and Loss details.
(iii) There should be an entry in the fields MULTI.VALUE.NO to             CON.ON.END for each application that is on the company record             and each occurrence of 'LOCAL' in FILE.NAME.             For those occurrences where an application has no entry,             then at the validation stage an override message is output             (the  message is "Application Name HAS NO ENTRY FOR No X").
(iv) The enrichment from the file will be displayed if the             record exists.  If the record does not exist but the value             is a possible valid value, then the enrichment 'RECORD             CURRENTLY NOT ON FILE' is displayed and this is not             treated as an error.  This allows for ranges to be loaded             when only part of the range is currently in use.
(v) The value of 'REST' is used when the values other than those             entered are to be combined under one code.             When REST is not entered, then the missing values keep their             own value.  When LOCAL.FIELD.NO contains two field numbers             value REST must be entered.
Validation Rules
Up to 35 type A (alphanumeric) characters.  Subvalue field, associated with fields LOCAL.START and LOCAL.END, multivalue association with field range APPLICATION to LOCAL.START and CON.ON.FILE to CON.ON.END.  Optional input.
Input must be a possible valid value of the file specified in LOCAL.FILE.NAME. If LOCAL.FIELD.NO contains a single field number.
Validation rules as defined in the application LOCAL.FILE.NAME for the field number entered in the LOCAL.FIELD.NO apply if it is a single field number.
Input is only allowed if LOCAL.START has been used.
Input is mandatory when LOCAL.FIELD.NO contains two field numbers.
When LOCAL.FIELD.NO contains two field numbers then at least two sets of 'conditions' must be present.
When fields LOCAL.START, LOCAL.END and LCL.COMBINED are set to null, aggregation will be for each individual value. */

(e.g. the consolidation key as one of its components contains the domicile code and a reporting requirement in one or more reports requires grouping of Common Market countries, a record with the corresponding domicile codes can be defined).
Several sets of include/exclude ranges may be defined for the same or different components in the consolidation key.

The content and layout of records on this file can be specified by RE STAT OUTPUT.
CRF report output is re-directed to a disk file by specifying the name of a record belonging to RE STAT OUTPUT in field 5 (OUTPUT MODE) on the CRF report request file (RE STAT REQUEST).
Printed reports and extract files may share the same basic report definition (ie. that on the files RE STAT REPORT HEAD, RE STAT REP LINE etc). The RE STAT OUTPUT record defines the structure of data extracted from the basic report in terms of:
-         the type of report lines to be extracted, and, per type           of line,
-         the data content to be extracted and its position within           the ouput record.
The types of report line available for printing or data extraction are:
-         'HEADING' lines, which describe the contents of their           following
-         'DETAIL' or 'LINK' lines, in which line details and           amounts are printed, and
-         'TOTAL' lines which are used to print running totals,           sub-totals or grand totals of the preceding lines.
Each occurence of a LINE TYPE on the output format record corresponds to a seperate record or line on the output file.
Within each occurence of a line type, the associated sub-valued fields are used to specify the content of the sequential record and its format.
The output defined by a record on this file is written to a sequential file under the directory RE CRF EXTRACT, with a key of (a) report name, (b) RE STAT OUTPUT record id and (c) date stamp (the three elements seperated by full-stops). */

The file RE.STAT.RANGE contains definitions of a range of values or a set of individual values for a report line content definition.
It will allow setting up of "standard", often used or virtual views as a help or short cut in the report line definition process. (e.g. the consolidation key as one of its components contains the domicile code and a reporting requirement in one or more reports requires grouping of Common Market countries, a record with the corresponding domicile codes can be defined).
The eventual usage of the defined range will be recorded by the system and reversals of ranges will be monitored/not allowed if they are still in use.

As for the field specified in the Consolidate Cond ASSET & LIAB record.     Multivalue field associated with fields 21.1 to 24.1 and 26.1 to 38.1.     Optional input.
If the value entered does not start with an * (asterisk), then it must be     a valid value according to length, type, etc. of the original field.
If value entered starts with an * (asterisk), the data following the     asterisk must be a key to a record on the RE.STAT.RANGE file.
When linking to the RE.STAT.RANGE file, then the CONSOL field (Field 3) on     that file, must have the same value as the name loaded for this field from     CONSOLIDATE.COND.
If this variable is not from a General file and has not been specified on     the CONSOLIDATE COND file for Application in ASSET APPLIC ID (Field 21.1)     then no input is allowed here.
If a value is entered in this field, then ASSET APPLIC ID (Field 21.1)     must not be null.
Input would not be allowed, if the Line is for a  default     (non-company specific) Report  (explained below) and the field     FILE.NAME for the variable  is "NO LOOKUP" in the record with     ID "ASSET&LIAB"


The above referred matching and validation is only for lines defined for  default (non-company specific)  reports i.e. the BRANCH.MODE is not equal to Y in the Report's (specified in the first part of the ID) RE.STAT.REPORT.HEAD record; For validation, the default consolidation definition in the record with ID "ASSET&LIAB" would be used. Further, if  a  CRF key variable has two components separated by "_"  due to redefinition of  the  variable  in Company specific consolidation record (explained below), then the matching of the CRF key would depend on the first component of the variable, before the character "_".
If the LINE has been  defined for a Company specific Report i.e. BRANCH.MODE=Y in RE.STAT.REPORT.HEAD record, then the matching and validation  would be done as follows:
1.  The value of the field BRANCH in RE.STAT.REPORT.HEAD record would determine for which Company the Report needs to be generated. The Report would not be generated for other Companies.
2.  The company specific consolidation key is first  determined for the Company specified as BRANCH. For the Company with ID "xxxxxxxxx", if  in the COMPANY record,  the  field CONS.KEY.CO is null, then the Company specific consolidation key would be the record  with the ID "ASSET&LIAB.xxxxxxxxx". If on the other hand, if the field CONS.KEY.CO refers  to another Company, say with ID "yyyyyyyyy", then the Company specific consolidation key would be the record with the ID "ASSET&LIAB.yyyyyyyyy".
3. If  the  variable field had been  redefined in the Company specific consolidation record (as determined above), then the second component of the CRF key variable  (followed by the character "_") would be matched. The validation for input would also depend on the definition of the variable, in the Company specific consolidation record.
4. If the variable had not been redefined in the Company specific consolidation record (as determined above), then the CRF key variable would have only one component, and it would be matched.

The format code and length is obtained from the original program using file name and field number as specified on the consolidation conditions record. These fields will be part of the first set of multivalue associated fields. The possible maximum of twelve variable fields is in addition to the four standard, fixed components as defined in the Fields 21.1 to 24.1 above.


Example: When loading details about the consolidation records to be included in a line, (Fields 21.1 - 37.1), it is not necessary to enter a value in each field. A null value means that any value for that actual field is allowed. Each consolidation record and type is matched against the line details loaded, to determine in which line(s) the CRF details are to be included. This match is done by a priority basis. The priority basis is:- Variable 1, Variable 2, Variable 3, Variable 4, Variable 5, Variable 6, Variable 7, Variable 8, Variable 9, Variable 10, Variable 11, Variable 12, Type, Currency, Position Type, Currency Market, Applic.

Validation Rules


As for the field specified in the Consolidate Cond ASSET & LIAB record.     Multivalue field associated with fields 21.1 to 24.1 and 26.1 to 38.1.     Optional input.
If the value entered does not start with an * (asterisk), then it must be     a valid value according to length, type, etc. of the original field.
If value entered starts with an * (asterisk), the data following the     asterisk must be a key to a record on the RE.STAT.RANGE file.
When linking to the RE.STAT.RANGE file, then the CONSOL field (Field 3) on     that file, must have the same value as the name loaded for this field from     CONSOLIDATE.COND.
If this variable is not from a General file and has not been specified on     the CONSOLIDATE COND file for Application in ASSET APPLIC ID (Field 21.1)     then no input is allowed here.
If a value is entered in this field, then ASSET APPLIC ID (Field 21.1)     must not be null.
Input would not be allowed, if the Line is for a  default     (non-company specific) Report  (explained below) and the field     FILE.NAME for the variable  is "NO LOOKUP" in the record with     ID "ASSET&LIAB"


The above referred matching and validation is only for lines defined for  default (non-company specific)  reports i.e. the BRANCH.MODE is not equal to Y in the Report's (specified in the first part of the ID) RE.STAT.REPORT.HEAD record; For validation, the default consolidation definition in the record with ID "ASSET&LIAB" would be used. Further, if  a  CRF key variable has two components separated by "_"  due to redefinition of  the  variable  in Company specific consolidation record (explained below), then the matching of the CRF key would depend on the first component of the variable, before the character "_".
If the LINE has been  defined for a Company specific Report i.e. BRANCH.MODE=Y in RE.STAT.REPORT.HEAD record, then the matching and validation  would be done as follows:
1.  The value of the field BRANCH in RE.STAT.REPORT.HEAD record would determine for which Company the Report needs to be generated. The Report would not be generated for other Companies.
2.  The company specific consolidation key is first  determined for the Company specified as BRANCH. For the Company with ID "xxxxxxxxx", if  in the COMPANY record,  the  field CONS.KEY.CO is null, then the Company specific consolidation key would be the record  with the ID "ASSET&LIAB.xxxxxxxxx". If on the other hand, if the field CONS.KEY.CO refers  to another Company, say with ID "yyyyyyyyy", then the Company specific consolidation key would be the record with the ID "ASSET&LIAB.yyyyyyyyy".
3. If  the  variable field had been  redefined in the Company specific consolidation record (as determined above), then the second component of the CRF key variable  (followed by the character "_") would be matched. The validation for input would also depend on the definition of the variable, in the Company specific consolidation record.
4. If the variable had not been redefined in the Company specific consolidation record (as determined above), then the CRF key variable would have only one component, and it would be matched. The validation for input would then depend on the  definition of  the variable  in the record with ID "ASSET&LIAB". */

Further, if  a  CRF key variable has two components separated by "_"  due to redefinition of  the  variable  in Company specific consolidation record (explained below), then the matching of the CRF key would depend on the first component of the variable, before the character "_".
If the LINE has been  defined for a Company specific Report i.e. BRANCH.MODE=Y in RE.STAT.REPORT.HEAD record, then the matching and validation  would be done as follows:
1.  The value of the field BRANCH in RE.STAT.REPORT.HEAD record would determine for which Company the Report needs to be generated. The Report would not be generated for other Companies.
2.  The company specific consolidation key is first  determined for the Company specified as BRANCH. For the Company with ID "xxxxxxxxx", if  in the COMPANY record,  the  field CONS.KEY.CO is null, then the Company specific consolidation key would be the record  with the ID "ASSET&LIAB.xxxxxxxxx". If on the other hand, if the field CONS.KEY.CO refers  to another Company, say with ID "yyyyyyyyy", then the Company specific consolidation key would be the record with the ID "ASSET&LIAB.yyyyyyyyy".
3. If  the  variable field had been  redefined in the Company specific consolidation record (as determined above), then the second component of the CRF key variable  (followed by the character "_") would be matched. The validation for input would also depend on the definition of the variable, in the Company specific consolidation record.

The above referred matching and validation is only for lines defined for  default (non-company specific)  reports i.e. the BRANCH.MODE is not equal to Y in the Report's (specified in the first part of the ID) RE.STAT.REPORT.HEAD record; For validation, the default consolidation definition in the record with ID "PROFIT&LOSS" would be used. Further, if  a  CRF key variable has two components separated by "_"  due to redefinition of  the  variable  in Company specific consolidation record (explained below), then the matching of the CRF key would depend on the first component of the variable, before the character "_".




If the LINE has been  defined for a Company specific Report i.e. BRANCH.MODE=Y in RE.STAT.REPORT.HEAD record, then the matching and validation  would be done as follows:




1.  The value of the field BRANCH in RE.STAT.REPORT.HEAD record would determine for which Company the Report needs to be generated. The Report would not be generated for other Companies.




2.  The company specific consolidation key is first  determined for the Company specified as BRANCH. For the Company with ID "xxxxxxxxx", if  in the COMPANY record,  the  field CONS.KEY.CO is null, then the Company specific consolidation key would be the record  with the ID "PROFIT&LOSS.xxxxxxxxx". If on the other hand, if the field CONS.KEY.CO refers  to another Company, say with ID "yyyyyyyyy", then the Company specific consolidation key would be the record with the ID "PROFIT&LOSS.yyyyyyyyy".

When this field is set to 'Y', a Consolidation key value would be fitted into the Report   using the Company specific (second) component of the  key variables. If for a particular key variable, there is no  Company specific definition  (i.e. the key variable has only one component without  '_' suffixed ), then value of that variable would be used.
When this field is not set to  'Y', the consolidation keys would be fitted into the Report  using the default (first) component of the consolidation file key variables.
Example: The consolidation variable SECTOR is redefined for Company CO2 (ID:US0010002) in the CONSOLIDATE.COND records ASSET&LIAB.US0010002 and PROFIT&LOSS.US0010002. The Report CO2STD is  based on the Company specific values of consolidation keys. Lines of the report CO2STD are  defined with  values relevant to the Company CO2. The report CO2STD is relevant for Company CO2 only and the fields BRANCH.MODE and BRANCH are  respectively updated with 'Y' and 'US0010002'.
If the value of this field is set to 'Y', while fitting the consolidation key  AC.1.TR.GBP.1001..1_10.5400_001.8530_8530._8.GB.003_._._100 into the Report,  for the first  and seventh variables which have only one component (since not  redefined in Company specific CONSOLIDATE.COND records), their  values '1001' and 'GB' of   would be used. However, for other variables which have  a second component, only those values  would be used. Thus the values of  '10'  for the third  variable '1_10', '001'  for the fourth variable '5400_001', '8530' for the fifth variable '8530_8530', '8'  for the sixth variable '_8', null for the eight variable '003_', null for the nineth variable '_' and '100'  for the tenth variable '_100' would be used.
In the above case, if the value of this field is not set to 'Y', then for all the variables,  values of the first component would be used to fit into the Report.  Thus the values of 1001,null,1,5400,8530,null,GB,003,null,null  would be respectively used for the ten variables to fit into the Report.

When a report is defined, it is possible to specify whether it is a Company specific report, by setting the field BRANCH.MODE to 'Y'.

If no value is specified for this field  (i.e. when BRANCH.MODE is Null or 'NO'), then the Report contents  would be determined for all Companies, using the default (first) component of consolidation key variables.
