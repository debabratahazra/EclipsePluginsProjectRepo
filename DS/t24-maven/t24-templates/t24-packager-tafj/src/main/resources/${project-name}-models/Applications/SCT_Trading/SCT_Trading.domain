	/* Bulk SEC.TRADE transactions can be authorised in one of three ways ; 1. Using the authorise function online by replying NO to the prompt "Update through bulk order processing Y/NO ?" Which will cause the transaction to authorised immediately online but runs the risk of cache errors if the transaction is too large. 2. Answering Y to the prompt "Update through bulk order processing Y/NO ? and let the end of day authorise the trade. This is done by the Batch Job SC.EOD.BULK.PROCESS which forms part of the BATCH SC.BATCH.APP. 3. Answering Y to the prompt "Update through bulk order processing Y/NO ?" and running the background SEC.TRADE authorising phantom through SC.ORD.CONTROL which will authorise the transaction after a delay of a few minutes. The delay will be between the screen control being returned to the user and the phantom picking up the SEC.TRADE for authorisation.
If the user types Y to the bulk update prompt then the SEC.TRADE transaction will only be available for the S (See) and P (Print) functions until it has been authorised.
The background phantom can be kicked off and shutdown by the SC.ORD.CONTROL record SYSTEM. Any other records on the SC.ORD.CONTROL file are used by the phantom process and cannot be accessed through T24.
To kick off the phantom the V (Verify) function has to be used on the SC.ORD.CONTROL record SYSTEM with the START.PROCESS field set to YES.

	/* Within the Securities module the Securities Trade Application is without doubt the most important and versatile of the Transaction processes. It allows for Multi Customer/Broker input and permits the user to transact entries in multi currency Customer accounts where say a transaction may well settle against one particular currency on the Broker side.  Wherever and whenever possible the Securities Trade Input will calculate automatically both the number of days accrued interest and the actual amount of accrued interest.  In addition it will access various Stock Exchange Tables in order to calculate automatically local commissions and charges.
Again wherever possible (and depending on the quality of the Static Information Files) T24 will at Transaction level default to Customer Broker, Depository and Security details.
Financial accounts and Security positions are updated and all commissions, taxes, fees etc. will be entered against category type files in accordance with Standard T24 principles.  All Sales will update positions immediately at validation, whereas purchase transactions only at Authorisation.
At end of day all Unauthorised Transactions will be reversed and placed on HOLD status.
T24 would advise that customers appreciate the impact of all unauthorised transactions on for example FX positions when considering their policy regarding Validation and Authorisation with regards End of Day. */

		/* Identifies the Stock Exchange that the security is traded on.
The stock exchange determines several events within the Sec.Trade application.
1.         Automatic calculation of the Value date depending on the            information opened within that Stock.Exchange record
2.         Automatic link to the standard stock Exchange            commissions and charges as stored within the various            Stock.Exchange tables and again determined by the            information within that particular Stock.Exchange            record.
Each Stock Exchange is linked to a seperate            Stock.Exchange Calculation table which contains all the            local charges, stamps and taxes. Plus it allows the user            to store the commission rates that YOU the Bank would            normally charge to the client yourselves.
Normally when entering a Sec.Trade the User is obliged            to enter the Stock Exchange at which the transaction was            effected.            The system will then go via the Stock Exchange  to the            Calculation table and default all the brokerage, stamps            taxes etc. accirding to the rates stored within those            tables.            However there are 3 seperate options available to the            User when entering a Sec.Trade which directly affects            the commissions etc being calculated.
1.         In Sec.Trade Field 9 there is a GROSS/NET indicator            which defaults at the moment to NO i.e NOT NET.            This means that the trade is Not Net of commission and            the default commissions should take affect.            If the flag is set to YES however that tells the system that            it is a Net trade and that No commissions whatsoever are            to be charged.            This then overrides all other default commission rates.
2.         Within the Stock.Exchaneg table there is a link to the            Calculation Table at Field 3 which is called "CALC            COUNTRY".            If input here the country code specifies which if any            Calculation table is to be used.It is an optional field and            if there is no link to the Calculation Tables then the            system will default 0.00s.
3.         Stored within the Customer.Security record are Customer            and Broker rates which if input will obviously override            any general rates as stored within the Stock.Exchange            Tables.
The Flow within Sec.Trade is therefore:-
1. Check Net/Groos flag.            If "YES" No Automatic calculation.            If "NO"  System carries on.
2. For Customer and Broker it then checks the            Customer.Security record for individual commission            tarriffs.            If the "Calc.Country" indicator within the            Stock.Exchange record is links to the Stock.Exchange            calculation tables then the syetm will use these rates to            default all the other  fees payable under that Stock            Exchange.

2. Automatic link to the standard stock Exchange commissions and charges as stored within the various Stock.Exchange tables and again determined by the information within that particular Stock.Exchange record.
Each Stock Exchange is linked to a separate Stock.Exchange Calculation table which contains all the local charges, stamps and taxes. Plus it allows the user to store the commission rates that YOU the Bank would normally charge to the client yourselves. Normally when entering a Sec.Trade the User is obliged to enter the Stock Exchange at which the transaction was effected.
The system will then go via the Stock Exchange to the Calculation table and default all the brokerage, stamps taxes etc. according to the rates stored within those tables.
However there are 3 separate options available to the User when entering a Sec.Trade which directly affects the commissions etc being calculated.
1. In Sec.Trade Field 9 there is a GROSS/NET indicator which defaults at the moment to NO i.e. NOT NET.
This means that the trade is Not Net of commission and the default commissions should take affect.
If the flag is set to YES however that tells the system that it is a Net trade and that No commissions whatsoever are to be charged. This then overrides all other default commission rates.
2. Within the Stock.Exchange table there is a link to the Calculation Table at Field 3 which is called "CALC COUNTRY". If input here the country code specifies which if any Calculation table is to be used. It is an optional field and if there is no link to the Calculation Tables then the system will default 0.00s.
3. Stored within the Customer.Security record are Customer and Broker rates which if input will obviously override any general rates as stored within the Stock.Exchange Tables.
The Flow within Sec.Trade is therefore:-
1. Check Net/Gross flag. If "YES" No Automatic calculation. If "NO" System carries on.
2. For Customer and Broker it then checks the Customer.Security record for individual commission tariffs.
If the "Calc.Country" indicator within the Stock.Exchange record is links to the Stock.Exchange calculation tables then the system will use these rates to default all the other fees payable under that Stock Exchange.
If it finds no individual tariffs within Customer.Security for either the Client or Broker then it will use the default rates within the Stock Exchange calculation tables.
If there is NO link between the Stock Exchange Table and the Stock.Exchange Calculation tables and there are No individual tariffs for the Client or Broker then the system will default 0.00s.

Allowed Input are the following types of "Customer".            1) Broker.            2) Counterparty.            3) Client.
Whereas the Broker and Counterparty are self explanatory the Client may be a Customer of the Bank who is not traditionally known as either a Broker or Counterparty but as a Client (Without a Portfolio) who transacts business with the Bank.  It is therefore permissible within the Sec.Trade appliaction to enter a transaction on the "Broker" side of the transaction who will Purchase securities from a Client who is selling those securities.
The system is intelligent enough to know that the Client is effectively a Customer without a Portfolio and will ensure that the accounting proceedures for this transaction are dealt with properly.


Example:   Examle of a typical transaction.            Portfolio client buys stock.            All commissions stamps and taxes are added to the amount            that will be debited to the clients' account.            On the Broker side even though the transaction code is            input as a sale the commissions,stamps and taxes are            added to the amount that is payable to the Broker.
But with a non Portfolio Client this is entered within the            Broker side of the Sec.Trade and if it is a Sale the            System will deduct commissions, taxes etc. and likewise            with the Broker side all P  L will be deducted from the            amount that the Broker will pay.
