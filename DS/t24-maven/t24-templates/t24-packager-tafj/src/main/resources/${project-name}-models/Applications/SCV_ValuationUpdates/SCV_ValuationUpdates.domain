For derivatives it has three parametric set up given detailed below.
Positional
Futures - Cost price is the weighted average of all the buy and sell price taken together
Options - when PREM.POST.TIME is 'TRADE' cost price is the weighted average of all buy prices alone if the buy lots are more than the sell lots, else weighted average of all sell prices if the sell lots are more than BUY lots. in case PREM.POST.TIME is 'SETTLEMENT' it will behave as future contract

BUY.SELL.POS
Cost price is multi-value field with the weighted average of all buy transactions as one and  weighted average of all sell transactions as another field

Transactional
Cost price will be shown transaction wise for each transaction as a multi-value field. Here for each transaction, cost price will be same as the price.

The value of this field is calculated in a similar way to the COST.PRICE field but using value dated positions.
If the position is for a security then this figure contains the calculated cost for a single security in the security currency. It is calculated using the VALUE.DATED.COST field from the SECURITY.POSITION record that gave rise to this entry on the SC.POS.ASSET file. It is calculated as follows ;
COST.PRICE = (VD.COST * PERC.FACTOR) / (VD.NOMINAL * MULT.FACTOR)
Where VD.COST is the value contained in the VALUE.DATED.COST       field on the SECURITY.POSITION record.       PERC.FACTOR is 100 if the Security price is expressed in       percentage terms (found from the PRICE.TYPE record       associated with the security) and 1 otherwise.       MULT.FACTOR is the multiplication factor for the security       (found from the PRICE.TYPE record associated with the       security).       VD.NOMINAL is the value dated nominal balance found from the       SECURITY.POSITION record field VALUE.DATED.POSN. If the position is built from more than one SECURITY.POSITION record then the COST.PRICE is pro-rated.
If the position is for a FOREX contract then this field will contain the exchange rate of the deal (if the portfolio reference currency is one of the currencies involved in the deal) or the market or forward rate between the currency in the associated SECURITY.CCY value and the portfolio reference currency at the time of the original contract. It is retained as the cost price until the contact matures and is removed from the portfolio valuation.
If the position is for a Forward Rate Agreement then this field will contain the value in the INTEREST.RATE field of the original contract.
If the position is for an Account then this field will be blank.
If the position is for a Money Market contract or for a Loans and Deposits contract then this field will be blank.
If the position is for a Fiduciary contract then this field will be blank.
If the position is for a Miscellaneous Deal then this field will be blank.
