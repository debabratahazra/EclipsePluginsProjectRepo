	/* PRE-SYNDICATION FILE is made available for input of basic details of syndication.

This file would contain details of the amount of the loan that is syndicated, the lead manager, co-manager etc to the issue, underwriting made and devolved, details of participants and their share in the syndicate and so on.


If the Facility is granted to a conglomerate rather than a single customer, creation of customer table is mandatory for each of the company that may be involved. CUSTOMER.LIABILITY field in the CUSTOMER table is used for credit grouping purposes. This field allows customer exposure to be consolidated at the branch or country level by the LIMIT application, while analysing risk. It also populates a T24 table CUSTOMER.LIABILITY listing out all the liability numbers (customer numbers) that come under the parent customer.


For such type of syndication that is granted to a group, the parent customer reference is input in the CUSTOMER field in the PRE-SANCTION file. Drawings under the Facility would be permitted to any of the customers who have been linked to the parent customer through CUSTOMER.LIABILITY. The extent to which each company may draw on the Facility may be effectively controlled through the existing LIMIT application in T24 as well as by appropriate definition of Tranches in FACILITY file.
In the PRESYNDICATION.FILE the bank may record the date and amount of the mandate, the type of credit line that is solicited, the banks to whom information memorandum is circulated, their responses to such circulation, details of underwriting made and subscriptions brought by each underwriter, details of participation interest received and allotted, details of underwriting that has been devolved and parties involved.
Once the entire credit line is tied up, by flagging CREATE.FACILITY field, the appropriate facility files could be created. */
