 /* Defines the Repayment type of the All in One Accounts opened under this product. This type determines the way in which the loan / deposit account is to be repaid. The repayment types available for loan accounts are: 1. ANNUITY This type of loan has a fixed periodic repayment amount (the 'annuity') consisting of two variable components of principal and interest. The repayment amount is calculated at the start of the contract so that the principal will be fully repaid after the required number of repayments. Initially, repayments consist mostly of interest. However, as the contract progresses, the size of the principal component increases as the accrued interest reduces. In All in One loan account, for defining a zero repayment at the start of the loan, for a fixed period, Annuity type of repayment can be defined in the schedule with amount as Zero. 2. LINEAR Linear loans also have an interest and a principal component to their periodic repayments. In this case, however, the principal repayment amount remains fixed over the lifetime of the contract. The interest element reduces as the accrued interest on the reducing balance decreases. This leads to a repayment scheme whereby the total periodic repayment reduces over the lifetime of the contract. 3. NONRED In NONRED type of  loans, there is no regular repayment of principal, but only interest. The redemption of Principal  will be done on maturity date of the loan. In All in One account loans, the validations relating to Interest Only and Maximum Period interest only will not happen for this type of loan. 4. OTHER Non structured repayments are handled under this type. Repayment of any amount on any dates are allowed, provided the total repayment amount is equal to principal. 5.CREDIT CARD This type of Loan repayment type was added from G14.0.00. For this repayment type, the schedules are NO. When the repayment type is Credit Card the regular schedules are discarded, sub a/cs are created and new types of schedules like CI, CC are generated automatically. Repayment types available for Deposit accounts are: FIXED Deposit amount is accepted in a fixed lump sum and repaid as fixed amount either with interest accumulated or not. SAVING PLAN Deposit amount is accepted in a periodic basis and the principal is increased in a recurring manner till the end of a fixed term. Validation Rules 1 to 12 Alpha characters.

 AZ_PRODUCT_PARAMETER__HIGHEST_RANGE 
 { 
 /* This field should be read along with the field AMT.PERCENT. Input in this field indicates the product is RANGED Revolving type.  It is a multi value set. The field Highest Range can take only amount which implies the range. Each drawals is taken and is matched with the range within which it falls. The %age or the amount specified in the range under amt. percent field is applied to arrive at the CC amount. REVOLVING.RATIO *10% HIGHEST.RANGE 100000 AMT.PERCENT B*100 HIGHEST.RANGE 300000 AMT.PERCENT *10 HIGHEST.RANGE 500000 AMT.PERCENT 250000 (1) A '*', before the numeric entered in AMT.PERCENT is must or else the system will deem it as amount and will generate CC schedule for only USD10 and not 10% of the outstanding. (2) A 'B*100', implies '100% of the balance in the acct'.  This is because when the outstanding in a sub acct falls within this range then it is obvious that as per the minimum class an amount of 100000 is payable.  However, if the outstanding in the acct is 98573 in that case CC schedule amount will be more than the outstanding that is actually payable if we stick to the concept of 100000 minimum. To obviate this we have introduced the concept 100% of the balance outstanding or 100000. (3) The fields Highest Range and Amt. Percent can be multi valued to specify different ranges.  Amt. Percent field can be input either with a %age or an amount. A sub acct indicating a draw down is taken and is matched for a range within which it falls and the %age specified in the amt. percent field for that range is applied.  If the AMT.PERCENT field contains an amount the system doesn't calculate any %age, but takes the amount as the 'CC' amount. For ex: (1)  Reference to the table, if the amount of draw down in a sub a/c comes to 250000 then it falls within the range of 300000 hence attracts 10% of the range as the 'CC' amount. (2)  Similarly, if the draw down in a sub a/c comes to 500000 then it attracts a flat amount of 250000 instead of any % age since the AMT.PERCENT field contains an amount. (3)  If the draw down in a sub a/c comes to 600000, since there is no range within which it falls it automatically attracts the revolving %age for generation of 'CC' schedule amount, which in the present case (refer table) will be 10%.
