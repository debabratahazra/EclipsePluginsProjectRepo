On the date so defined, the rate will be applied to the execution value of each collateral main file record belonging to this type. However, the rate may be omitted when the collateral type has an application-fed value defined under EXECUTION.VALUE or NOMINAL.VALUE. In this case, the revaluation is performed by applying the current balance of the contract or account to the collateral value field(s) and no explicit rate is therefore required.
