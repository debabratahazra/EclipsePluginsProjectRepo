All orders in the Derivatives module are double-sided, with one or more Primary counterparties (which may be customers, own-book dealers or brokers) versus a single Secondary counterparty.       The application provides powerful and intuitive features for the input of Derivatives trading data, allowing maturity dates, prices and commissions to be entered or automatically defaulted in the formats favoured by the Bank's back office. */

In this case, the Nostro account number of our agent should be entered in the OUR.ACCOUNT.PAY field. If the counterparty's bank is known to us (i.e. there is a customer record), then the bank's number should be entered in CPARTY.CORR.NO if these have not yet been defined on the Agency file. If the bank is not known to us (i.e. there is no customer record), the bank's name and address should be entered in the multi-valued field CPY.CORR.ADD. When known, the counterparty's account number at his bank should be entered in the field CPARTY.BANK.ACC.        To an account at another bank locally        Where payment is to be effected locally, settlement can be through a number of different methods. The most common are Banker's Payments, CHIPS, or CHAPS. In all cases, the number of our internal clearing account, or our clearing agent should be entered in OUR.ACCOUNT.PAY. Details of the CPARTY's bank account should be completed as detailed above.        To a beneficiary of the CPARTY        The CPARTY may nominate a third party beneficiary of the funds. If the beneficiary is to be paid by crediting an account with us, the account number should be entered in OUR.ACCOUNT.PAY. If the beneficiary does not have an account with us, the internal clearing number or Nostro account of our agent should be entered in OUR.ACCOUNT.PAY.        Where we are paying to another bank but the beneficiary is known to us (i.e. there is a customer record), the customer number of the beneficiary will be entered in the field BENEFICIARY.NO. Where no relationship exists, the payment details will be entered in the multi-valued field BENFCY.ADD.        Payment via an intermediary bank        Occasionally the CPARTY may ask for payment to be made through an intermediary bank. This occurs where the CPARTY or beneficiary's correspondent is not in the country of the currency involved. As an example, let us say that the Bank 'ABC' in Hong Kong uses Bank 'XYZ' in Hong Kong as their dollar agent. When a dollar payment is to be made we would pay American Bank in New York (the Intermediary) for Bank 'XYZ' in HK (the CPARTY correspondent), account Bank 'ABC' (the CPARTY or Beneficiary). The Intermediary can be entered as a number in the INTERMED.BK.NO field if a customer relationship exists (i.e. there is a customer number) or as narrative in the INTERMED.ADD field.        Validation Rules       Up to 4 lines of 35 characters. Multivalue field         associated with field range OUR.ACCOUNT.PAY to REC.ADV.NARR.       Input in this field is not allowed when details have been         entered in the intermediary bank number field.       Input is only allowed when Our Account Pay represents a         Nostro account.       Input is not acceptable for Negotiated or other internal         deals.       Input is not allowed unless the CPARTY is known (i.e.         deal sub-type is not 'BR').       Input will only be allowed if details of the         correspondent have been entered.       Input will not be allowed if there is a common         correspondent signified by COMMONCORR being entered in         the CPARTY.CORR.NO field. */
