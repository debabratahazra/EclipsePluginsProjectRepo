 /* OVERVIEW FOR REPGEN SORT This module creates a sort file using the program created in REPGEN.SOURCE for a report defined in the file REPGEN.CREATE. This step in the report generation can be run on-line or be part of a end-of-day job stream. This routine maintains records on the REPGEN.SORT file which are called up when a report is to be produced. The records are loaded using the (I)nput or (C)opy functions. The (V)erify function is used to produce the report on line.  If Verify mode is run and the REPGEN.CREATE record has been updated but REPGEN.SOURCE not run an override message appears. The functions (L)ist, (P)rint, (R)eversal and (S)ee are also available. The end of day production of these types of reports is explained in the REPGEN.OUTPUT overview. The sort file created, with the information as of the last creation, is available for print or display until the next creation or until physically removed through use of the module REPGEN.FROP.LIST. unless the print run was asked to delete the sort file. */

 /* OVERVIEW FOR REPGEN OUTPUT The module REPGEN.OUTPUT allows selection of a report for print or display on the screen.  It also contains the definition of the language (code) in which the report headers, titles and labels must be printed.  It provides for extra copies to be printed and the definition of a special page length for the printing of the report.  The work file between the Sort and Printed can be requested to be deleted. The ID of the file is a user-defined name or the report name itself.  If both print and display is required and/or different languages need to be output, the use of an ID different to the report is mandatory and the report name becomes an attribute in field 3. The language formats, i.e. the definition of the languages used and the corresponding descriptions and headers need to be defined in the file REPGEN.CREATE. The output definitions can be entered on-line for an on-line print or display of the report.  The required minimum input is a key, (which is necessary for the execution of the print or the display of the report and can be used each time a request is entered), the execution type (print/display) and the report name. The file type of REPGEN.OUTPUT is "W" (workfile) and therefore has a live version only. The output definition can be done as maintenance task only, using function "I" (input) or the C(copy) function or as definition and execution task combined using the function "V".  If first defined under "I", later execution on-line must also be triggered using the "V" function. If the report needs to be produced as part of the end of day, then a REPGEN.OUTPUT record, for the report, must still exist.  The name given to the REPGEN.OUTPUT record must then be entered as a data item in an appropriate BATCH record and there must be a REPGEN.SORT record with the same name. An appropriate Batch record is one that: (i)    has a batch job (Field 6) of Batch record that       will call upon the report generator and accept       'data' in the form of a REPGEN.OUTPUT record       (Field 11.1.1 of the BATCH.RECORD).       e.g. EB.PRINT (ii)   Is to be executed at the desired stage in the       end of the day run.       e.g. before or after the date change. If the REPGEN.CREATE record has been updated since the last run of REPGEN.SOURCE, an override message will be output. */

 /* The T24 Report Generator utility provides the means to define and produce reports.  It covers both the need to respond to an ad hoc request in an effective way or to run the defined reports in a regular batch control environment, within an application or system-wide End-of-Day process. The application consists of five modules as follows: REPGEN.CREATE       To define reports and maintain these report                     definitions. REPGEN.SOURCE       To generate source code and catalogue the                     programs. REPGEN.SORT         To create/set up a "work file" as source for                     print or display. REPGEN.OUTPUT       To define/trigger display or printing of a                     report. REPGEN.DROP.LIST    To physically delete existing work files,                     where this is not done as part of the                     processing. There is also a batch program which allows the report names to be entered, and will run the REPGEN SORT and REPGEN OUTPUT.  This batch program is called EOD REPGEN PRINT. For a new report the following sequence is to be followed:           Run REPGEN CREATE in Input and then Authorisation           mode to load the details of the report.           Run REGEN.SOURCE to create, compile and catalogue the           sort and print programs.           Run REPGEN SORT to load a record for running of the sort           and to run the sort.  Use 'I' input mode to load a record           and 'V' Verify to run the sort .  (Note 'V' mode can also be           used to load the record).           Run REPGEN.OUTPUT to load a record for the running of           the print and to run the print.  Use 'I' input mode and 'V'           Verify mode as for REPGEN.SORT. Every time a report is to be produced run:           REPGEN.SORT and REPGEN.OUTPUT. If a report is to be reprinted then run REPGEN OUTPUT only unless the sort files was deleted in which case REPGEN.SORT must be rerun. When a report is to be modified then run:           REPGEN.CREATE, REPGEN SOURCE, REPGEN.SORT and           REPGEN.OUTPUT, the later two for checking that the           change was correctly made. The module REPGEN.CREATE is the report definition and maintenance facility within the T24 report generator utility. All the standard functions within T24 (with the exception of H [history restore]) are available.  The file type is "U", i.e. no history is being kept and any maintenance overwrites the previous live version of a report definition.  The reversal function, in addition to the REPGEN.CREATE maintenance record, also physically removes the related source and the work file of the reversed ID. The report definition, as detailed in the field descriptions, is dealing with the following main components: Environment - A report can be set up to either reflect a single company (or financial data base), an aggregation of any number or combination of companies or an aggregation of all existing companies.  (For details please refer to Field 2 DEFINE COMPANY.) The source of the report can be a single file or any number (theoretically) of files as long as the (print) fields are compatible.  A practical example are the files STMT.ENTRY and CATEG.ENTRY which can be combined into a single activity or movement list type report. DATA - The source fields of the defined READ FILE can be manipulated or modified in several ways with regard to format, linkage to other files or as parameters of an arithmetic operation. Some of the facilities available are:           Linkage to other files, where the field value constitutes           the key to the next file is (theoretically) unlimited.  The           main use might be translation of an ID into the meaningful           description by linking to the main file. (for details refer to           Field 14.1 MODIFICATION)           Another usage of linkage is to obtain a run time variable           for the REPGEN SORT routine.  This is achieved by           entering the following data:           Field 13.1.1        Mnemon Field contains key of                               REPGEN SORT routine           Field 14.1.1        Modification is set to REPLACE           Field 15.1.1        Modif File is set to REPGEN                               SORT           Field 16.1.1        Modif Field is set to 5.1.1 etc. or                               6.1 etc. which is the field                               number from REPGEN SORT                               routine.           Amounts and dates are subject to special conversion into           output masks.  Foreign currency amounts will contain           correct number of decimals (link to CURRENCY table) and           date fields can be output in various formats (for details           refer to Field 20.1 SPECIAL MASK)           Common Subroutines can be used, a record specifying the           parameters to be used and the actual subroutine name must           be set up on the PGM.FILE, see field 14.1 MODIFICATION           for details and the chapter on REPGEN SUBROUTINES.           Arithmetic operations on all numeric field - for details           refer to Field MODIFICATION (Field 14.1).           A field can be set up depending upon whether a decision           set up in fields DECISION NAME (field 68.1) to REL NEXT           FD (field 75.1.1) is true or not see field 14.1           MODIFICATION for details. GROUPS - The expression/definition of "groups" allows production of several reports from a single file read.  It is based on decisions identifying the characteristics of such groups.  The output will be broken down accordingly and can contain separate descriptions or headers for each report.  The sorts and the print fields that are used may be different  for each group (for details refer to Fields 43.1 DECIS GROUP FR to 67.1 MNEMON.SEQU).  Field MNEMON.SEQU specifies fields to be used for printing and sorting.  Where a mnemonic is used in more than on group, it's value and use will be the same in all the groups it is used in. FORMAT - The presentation of reports can be controlled/defined with regard the column position of a field, the sequence, the page breaks, the page numbering, the blank lines and totals. The headings and titles can correspond to the standard of T24 reporting headings. See fields REPORT TITLE (Field 1), SPEC NUMB CHAR (Field 18.1) to TEXT (Field 26.1) and HDR 1 001- 040 (Field 27.1) to HDR 4 121 - 132  (Field 42.1) and GROUP TITLE (Field 47.1.1) to GROUP TEXT (Field 65.1.1) and fields NEW PAGE GROUP (Field 78) to EMPTY LINE WANTED (Field 84). A report limited to up to 80 columns can also be directed to a screen (for details refer to REPGEN.OUTPUT). */
