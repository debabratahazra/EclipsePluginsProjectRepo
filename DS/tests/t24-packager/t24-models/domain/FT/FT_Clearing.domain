 /* Specifies the name of the tape which is to be processed and the action which is to be performed upon it. The first part of the KEY, which is the name of the tape, must be a valid entry on the FT.TAPE.PARAMS file. The second part of the KEY, separated from the first by a "-", must be the action required. Depending on the direction of the tape, which is defined on the FT.TAPE.PARAMS record, one of six actions must be specified. For incoming tapes from the local clearing system one of the following three actions must be entered:           (i) LOAD       - This will load the specified tape into the                            work area.          (ii) APPROVE    - This approves tapes that require approval and                            results in the APPROVED.BY and APPROVAL.DATE                            fields being filled on FT.TAPE.REFERENCE and                            FT.TAPE.HIST         (iii) UPDATE     - This will generate the Funds Transfer entries                            from the details loaded.          (iv) CANCEL     - This will cancel the previously loaded tape.           (v) VERIFY     - This will run the UPDATE.RTN to create                            reporting records only and not entries. This                            can only be used if VERIFICATION in                            FT.TAPE.PARAMS = YES. For outgoing tapes to the local clearing system one of the following three actions must be entered:           (i) GENERATE   - This will generate the flat file to be put on                            the outgoing tape.          (ii) CREATE     - This will load the flat file onto the outgoing                            tape.         (iii) REGEN      - This will regenerate a previously generated                            tape. This action is used if for example an                            outgoing tape could not be read by the                            receiver and therefore has to be sent again. Validation RulesUp to 15 alphanumeric characters as follows:  - The first part of the KEY identifies the name of the tape to be   processed.  - The second part of the KEY separated from the first by a "-" is   the action to be performed.
