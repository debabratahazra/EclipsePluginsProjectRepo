"" is the lowest value a field can have, so specifying LT (Less Than) "" ensures that no override may be present.

If the system can link the APPLICATION to the field then the SMS restriction will be applied. In this example the COUNTERPARTY field on the FOREX file provides the link to the CUSTOMER file. Hence when the transaction is input T24 reads the CUSTOMER file using the COUNTERPARTY as the key and checks that the ACCOUNT.OFFICER is 100. You do not have to define that the COUNTERPARTY as the key to CUSTOMER file this is done automatically based on the RELATED.FILE stored in the STANDARD.SELECTION record for FOREX.   Note: If you wish to test a value in a related file a consderable process load can be incurred when the user lists the file. This can be relieved by defining the related field as a J-descriptor user field on the STANDARD.SELECTION record and using that. Thus in the example above define CUST.OFFICER as type J, CUSTOMER>ACCOUNT.OFFICER and then specify the FIELD.NO as FOREX>CUST.OFFICER.Validation Rules

Multi-value field associated with Fields 16-21 and 23.   (Mandatory input if FIELD NO is entered, otherwise input is not allowed.)   This field specifies either a single value or the lower limit of a range with which the contents of the field indicated in FIELD NO (Field 20) are compared.   Note: The values input in this field and the next one must be in agreement with the Format rules of the element specified in Field 20.1. If, for example, the input in Field 20 corresponds to a Customer Mnemonic, a minimum input of 3 characters will be required in this field.   When defining the enquires a user can run, you can also 'turn off' all SMS checks for a particular enquiry. This is useful when the enquiry presents non sensitive information from sensitive files. I.e you may wish to show customer and account static information (address, account titles etc ) but not show the balances. As the enquiry itself controls the presentation there may be no need for any additional security. To suppress SMS you must append *NOSMS to the name of the enquiry. E.G.   Field 17.1 (APPLICATION) ENQUIRY.SELECT  Field 19.1(FUNCTION) I  Field 20.1(FIELD.NO) 0  Field 21.1(DATA.COMPARISON) EQ  Field 22.1(DATA.FROM) CUSTOMER.STATIC*NOSMS  This mechanism works only with ENQUIRY.SELECT and must be entered in the format detailed above.Validation Rules
