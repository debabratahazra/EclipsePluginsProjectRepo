 /* The MG.SCHEDULES application records any future events on contracts by individual event date. The types of event that are recorded on this file are:            -    Repayments of principal and interest.            -    Repayments of additional payment types.            -    Penalty interest processing.            -    Principal movements.            -    Levying of charges. For each of these event types listed only the next occurence of this event is recorded on this file. For example a contract may require 300 repayments over the duration of its life. However, at any given time there will only be one repayment schedule for the next repayment date. Each record on this file is for a specific contract and a specific date. Therefore a single contract is likely to produce a number of records on this file. This file is maintained automatically by the system. There is no facility to manually update this file. */

 /* Uniquely identifies each record on this file. This field uniquely identifies each record on this file. It is made up of two components, the contract number and the date of the schedule, separated by a dot.  Both elements of the ID must be entered although there are shorthand forms of both. In the case of the schedule date this is a standard T24 date. A such only the elements of the date that differ from the current system date need be entered. The format of the contract number is as follows:            MG YYDDD NNNNN A where:     MG        -        Mortgage module identifier.            YYDDD     -        Year and date of contract input, in julian                             date format.            NNNNN     -        Sequence number which is unique for the date                               of input.            A         -        Contract suffix which must be defined on the                               MG.PARAMETER table. It is not necessary to enter the full contract number when viewing a schedule. The "MG" prefix is not required, neither is the julian date portion if the contract was entered during the current day. In all cases leading zeroes in the final sequence number portion of the key need no be entered. Example :            Current date  :     22/01/90            Schedule date :     28/02/90            Contract no.  :     MG9012300012 (input 12/01/90) The minimum input required is : 9012312.2802 This will be expanded to give the full schedule id:            MG9012300012.19900228 Validation RulesThis field has three components as follows: a)   A valid contract ID, 10 numeric characters prefixed by MG with      an optional 1 alpha suffix. b)   "." c)   8 numeric characters - standard date format.
