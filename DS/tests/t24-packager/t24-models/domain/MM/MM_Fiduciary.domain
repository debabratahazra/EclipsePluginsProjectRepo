 /* The Money Market Fiduciary Group Payment record contains the information to be used by the system when calculating interest on call/notice fiduciary contracts. In addition to this the date on  which interest is to be settled is entered in this table. This information is held for combinations of fiduciary bank, currency and notice period. Whenever a fiduciary contract is entered this table is checked to see if a record for the combination of fiduciary bank, currency and notice period from the contract exists on the fiduciary group payment table. If this record is missing then the contract will be rejected at the validation stage. Each record contains the interest rates applicable to the current interest period only. Once an interest settlement date has been passed then the record is written away to a history file, fiduciary group payment past. Each record contains all interest rates applicable to the interest period and the dates on which those rates become effective. The last rate from the previous period is also stored and is used as the first rate on the current table until a new rate is entered. An interest settlement date may be entered at any time to indicate the date on which the system should calculate and settle interest the interest due for that period. This calculation is performed by an end of day routine. This same routine then writes the fiduciary group payment record away to the 'past' file and creates a new record for the new interest period using the last rate applicable from the old table There follows a description of each fiduciary group payment field and its corresponding input. */

 /* This field holds the interest settlement date for the current interest period and an optional frequency for the automatic renewal of this date. Input of a date in this field will trigger the calculation of interest and commission for call/notice contracts associated with this fiduciary group payment record. The calculation is performed by the end of day routine on the date entered. The interest settlement date will be changed automatically by the period indicated by the frequency code whenever the date equates to the end-of-day process date. The following are examples of input into this field:        a)   310388 M0131 - represents the date from            which the frequency is initiated, where:            M  = month            01 = at one month intervals            31 = the last day of the month.        b)   310388 M0331 - represents a quarterly            interest due date frequency payable at            quarter end. Thus, in example a), interest will be liquidated on 31/03/88 and then on 30/04/88 and so on. In example b), interest will be liquidated on 31/03/88 and then on 30/06/88 and so on.

For example, if DEM payments are sent two days prior to their value date (DAYS.DELIVERY field in CURRENCY record DEM has a value of 2), then a DAILY frequency will not be allowed for a DEM Call/Notice deposit that has a nostro account as the interest liquidation account. For deposits, this is to ensure that payments are not made for future interest periods that have yet to begin.

 /* The Money Market Fiduciary Commission Table contains the information the system will use to calculate commissions to be charged to customers in respect of fiduciary deposits opened by those customers with the branch. A specific commission may be defined on the table in terms of a currency only or in terms of a currency and a customer. In the former case the system will use the information as default values in respect of commission to be charged with regard to a particular currency and in the absence of specific customer ID information. In the latter case commission charged can be identified in respect of currency and of a clearly identified customer so that for the customer in question the system will have at its disposal a set of unique commission details applicable specifically for that particular customer. The User also has the option to input a specific amount when loading a contract, and this amount may be completely independent of any conditions specified on the Fiduciary Commission Table. Thus if the Fiduciary Commission Table specifications would normally dictate a commission of say, 5,000.00 on a contract of 500,000.00, then the User may directly input say, 7,500.00 on loading a contract (field 50 Fiduciary Total Commission Amount), and in effect override the conditions set up on the Fiduciary Commission Table for the particular currency and customer in question. Clearly therefore, the system allows complete flexibility in permitting the User to approach the question of fiduciary commissions in any way he chooses.

Then:- a)   on 1st contract fiduciary commission is                  50,000.00 X 61 X 5%  is 417.81                  36,500        b)  on 2nd contract fiduciary commission is                  100,000.00 X 61 X 4%  is 668.49                  36,500.00        c)  on 3rd contract fiduciary commission is                  250,000.00 X 61 X 3%  is 1,253.42                  36,500.00 Note:      The day basis used in the calculation is            taken from the INTEREST.BASIS field on the            contract. From the examples given above it will be seen that the system always calculates a flat commission on the face value of the contract. If the principal amount on the contract changes during the period over which commission is calculated, then a weighted average of the individual principal amount will be used. The associated multivalue fields 3.1 and 4.1 may be expanded up to a maximum of 999, but however many are used, the last amount field of the group must be the maximum amount allowed by the system for the appropriate currency.  eg for a '2' decimal currency: 999,999,999,999.99     for a '0' decimal currency: 99,999,999,999,999 Validation RulesStandard amount format.
