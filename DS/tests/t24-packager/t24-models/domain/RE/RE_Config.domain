(e.g. a foreign currency control ledger sequence is obtained by inputting the expression 'BY.CURRENCY' into the Field 7 SPLIT).   The application RE.STAT.REP.LINE specifies the details for each line of the report.  The application RE.STAT.ENT.FORMAT specifies the details of the entries if this report is to include detailed entries for each line.   It is possible to have more than one header record for each set of Report lines, thus allowing for different heading details to be specified with the same line contents.

The Report CO2STD is  based on the Company specific values of consolidation keys. Lines of the report CO2STD are  defined with  values relevant to the Company CO2. The report CO2STD is relevant for Company CO2 only and the fields BRANCH.MODE and BRANCH are  respectively updated with 'Y' and 'US0010002'.    If the value of this field is set to 'Y', while fitting the consolidation key  AC.1.TR.GBP.1001..1_10.5400_001.8530_8530._8.GB.003_._._100 into the Report,  for the first  and seventh variables which have only one component (since not  redefined in Company specific CONSOLIDATE.COND records), their  values '1001' and 'GB' of   would be used. However, for other variables which have  a second component, only those values  would be used. Thus the values of  '10'  for the third  variable '1_10', '001'  for the fourth variable '5400_001', '8530' for the fifth variable '8530_8530', '8'  for the sixth variable '_8', null for the eight variable '003_', null for the nineth variable '_' and '100'  for the tenth variable '_100' would be used.    In the above case, if the value of this field is not set to 'Y', then for all the variables,  values of the first component would be used to fit into the Report.  Thus the values of 1001,null,1,5400,8530,null,GB,003,null,null  would be respectively used for the ten variables to fit into the Report.   Validation Rules  Allowed values are 'Y' and 'NO'  Default value is Null equivalent to 'NO' */

 /* Specifies the ID of the Company  for which the report  needs  to be generated.  It is possible to have two components in the variable parameters  of the consolidation file (CONSOLIDATE.ASST.LIAB and CONSOLIDATE.PRFT.LOSS) keys. The first and second components  of the variables would be updated  as per the definition in the default and  Company specific  CONSOLIDATE.COND records. When a report is defined, it is possible to specify whether it is a Company specific report, by setting the field BRANCH.MODE to 'Y'. Since Reports are common to  all Companies, this field would be  used to further specify the Company,  whose consolidation keys need to be fitted into the Report. For other Companies, the Report will not have any contents.    If no value is specified for this field  (i.e. when BRANCH.MODE is Null or 'NO'), then the Report contents  would be determined for all Companies, using the default (first) component of consolidation key variables.  For example, the variable SECTOR is redefined for Company CO2 (ID:US0010002) in the CONSOLIDATE.COND records ASSET&LIAB.US0010002 and PROFIT&LOSS.US0010002. The Report CO2STD is required only for Company CO2, and its Lines are  defined with  values relevant to the Company CO2. In this case, the fields BRANCH.MODE and BRANCH should be respectively updated with "Y" and "US0010002"; The report would be generated only for the Company CO2 using the Company specific components of the consolidation variables.

(e.g. the consolidation key as one of its components contains the domicile code and a reporting requirement in one or more reports requires grouping of Common Market countries, a record with the corresponding domicile codes can be defined).

 /* Fields 20.1 to 31.1 contain the possible maximum of twelve variable fields as part of the composite total consolidation key permissible in T24. They specify the conditions to be satisfied for reporting against this line. The "prompts" (or components) are moved by the system from the consolidation conditions record PROFIT&LOSS (Field 1.1. NAME).The format code and length is obtained from the original program using file name and field number as specified on the consolidation conditions record. These fields will be part of the first set of multivalue associated fields. The possible maximum of twelve variable fields is in addition to the one standard, fixed component as defined in the field 19.1.
        Example: When loading details about the consolidation records to be included in a line, (Fields 19.1 - 32.1), it is not necessary to enter a value in each field. A null value means that any value for that actual field is allowed.Each consolidation record and currency is matched against the line loaded, to determine in which line(s) the CRF detail are to be included.This match is done by a priority basis. The priority basis is:- Variable 1, Variable 2, Variable 3, Variable 4, Variable 5, Variable 6, Variable 7, Variable 8, Variable 9, Variable 10, Variable 11, Variable 12, Currency, Applic.ID.For purpose of this example assume Variable 1 is PL Category Code, Variable 2 is Product Category Code, and Variable 3-12 inclusive are not used.The following detail report lines have been loaded for the Report Statement of Condition ('SOC').PL Category Product Currency Applic ID CategorySOC104 51000 1000 GBP PL SOC105 51000 1000 PL SOC107 51000 GBP PL SOC108 51000 1000 USD PL SOC110 51000 PL SOC111 51000 FRF PL SOC112 1000 PL SOC114 BEF PLThe following CRF Records exist:APPLIC PL CATEGORY PRODUCT CCY LINE NO ID CATEGORYPL 51000 1000 GBP SOC104 PL 51000 1000 USD SOC108 PL 51000 2000 GBP SOC107 PL 51000 1000 FRF SOC105 PL 51000 2000 FRF SOC111 PL 51000 1000 BEF SOC105 PL 51000 2000 BEF SOC110 PL 50000 1000 GBP SOC112 PL 50000 2000 BEF SOC114 PL 50000 2000 FRF not reported as no matchValidation RulesAs for the field specified in the Consolidate Cond PROFIT&LOSS record.
