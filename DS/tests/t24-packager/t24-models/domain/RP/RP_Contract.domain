 /* A REPO is a Sale and Repurchase agreement where securities are sold to the counterparty at a fixed price and the seller has a commitment to repurchase those securities at a pre-determined price at a fixed point in time in the future.  The price difference can be seen as the interest to the deposit (or loan if reverse repo), and may be defined as a cash price (the buy back amount) or as a rate (the repo rate).  A Reverse Repo is the opposite of a Repo.  Thus for the two parties in any Repo deal, it will be a Repo deal for one party and a Reverse Repo deal for the other.  The two parties are usually referred to as the seller and the buyer to avoid confusion.The seller is the party who receives cash and delivers securities, and the buyer is the one who makes the loan and receives the securities.  The T24 REPO module supports the recording, processing and administration of both REPO and Reverse REPO transactions.  It incorporates these transactions into the Limit, Accounting and Position Management modules within T24 and supports a wide variety of repo and reverse repo types, such as:  Bond repo  Gilt repo  Equity repo  Bilateral repo  Trilateral repo  Cross currency repo  It also covers options such as:  Multiple securities  Substitution of securities  Early maturities  PSA/ISMA Agreement  The REPO application will only run using the T24 Graphical User Interface. */
