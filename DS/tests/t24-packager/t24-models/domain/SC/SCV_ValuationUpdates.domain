The value of this field is calculated in a similar way to the COST.PRICE field but using value dated positions.  If the position is for a security then this figure contains the calculated cost for a single security in the security currency. It is calculated using the VALUE.DATED.COST field from the SECURITY.POSITION record that gave rise to this entry on the SC.VALUATION.EXTRACT file.

PERC.FACTOR is 100 if the Security price is expressed in percentage terms (found from the PRICE.TYPE record associated with the security) and 1 otherwise. MULT.FACTOR is the multiplication factor for the security (found from the PRICE.TYPE record associated with the security). VD.NOMINAL is the value dated nominal balance found from the SECURITY.POSITION record field VALUE.DATED.POSN.

Otherwise this field will contain a value calculated by multiplying the V.DT.ESTIMATION amount by the Margin Rate for the position.     For all positions other than Securities (SC) and Fiduciaries (FD) then the Margin Rate will come from the MARGIN.RATE field in the ASSET.BY.CATEG record for the CATEGORY of the position - if there is one - and then default to the MARGIN.RATE field on the ASSET.TYPE record the position is linked to if there is no ASSET.BY.CATEG record. If the margin rate has not been entered on either of these files a rate os 0 is used.     If the position is for a Fiduciary (FD) contract then the system will first try to find the margin rate from the ASSET.BY.CATEG file, then use the MARGIN.RATE field on the FD.FID.ORDER record before finally using the ASSET.TYPE record if a margin rate has not been set-up on either of the other files.     If the position is for a Securities (SC) contract then the system will first see if there is a MARGIN.CONTROL record connected to the SECURITY.MASTER record for the Security. If there is the margin rate will be taken from the MARGIN.CONTROL record. If there is no MARGIN.CONTROL record connected to the Security then the margin rate will be taken from the MARGIN.RATE field of the SUB.ASSET.TYPE record the position is connected to.     If the position is for a Derivatives (DX) contract then this field contains the variation margin amount for value-dated positions.     Validation Rules     No input field.
