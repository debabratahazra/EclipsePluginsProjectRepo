 /* The template caters to rollover, merger (consolidation) or splitting of existing draw down/s under the same facility and with same maturity dates. The resultant loans can be in different currency, for a different tenor and with different interest rate/spread.
      Rollover
      Rollover option may be chosen if one existing drawing is to be rolled over for a further period in the same or different currency. That is there would be one underlying drawing and the resultant drawing would also be one, though the currency may be different.
      Merger
      Merger option may be chosen if more than one existing drawing are to be merged into one or more drawing. The resultant drawing/s could be in any allowed currency. The maturity date of all the existing drawing to be merged must be the same.
      Split
      Split option may be chosen of one existing drawing is to be split into many drawings. The resultant drawings could be in any allowed currency.
      For each of the above options further flexibility is available to cater to the following
      a)Different term for the resultant drawing/s
      b)Different rate of interest (based on the new term)
      c)
      
      Rollover with principal increase
      d)
      
      Rollover with principal decrease (net of repayment of the existing drawing)
      e)
      
      Netting of payment for each currency
      f) Exchange variance check for a rollover from one optional currency to the same optional currency 
      g) Automatic creation of new loans subsequent to rollover */

 /* Defines the kind of activity to be performed on the drawings under a facility on the maturity date. The allowed options are ROLLOVER or MERGER or SPLIT. The drawings under a facility may be done in any of the allowed currencies. On the maturity date a drawing could be rolled over for a further period in any of the allowed currencies. Few drawings could be merged into one or more drawings in any of the allowed currencies. Similarly a drawing could be split into more than one drawing in any of the allowed currencies.Validation Rules
        For option ROLLOVER only one drawing under the facility can be selected       for further rollover.For option ROLLOVER the resultant deal would be only one i.e a GBP       drawing can be rolled over into one drawing only in any of the allowed       currency.For option MERGER one or more drawings can be selected. If more than one       drawing is selected then the these drawings could be merged into one or       more drawings. For example a GBP drawing and a USD drawing can be merged       into one GBP/USD drawing or into one GBP and EUR drawing.For option SPLIT only one drawing under the facility may be selected and       split into more than one drawing in any of the allowed currencies. */

Presently it has six values viz.       0 - OTHERS     1 - INPUT     2 - AMENDMENT     3 - NOTICE      4 - CONFIRMATION           5 - REVERSALThe third digit indicates the component for which the message is being generated viz. Principal or Interest or commitment fee etc.  Presently it has five values viz.   0 - OTHERS   1 - PRINCIPAL                         2 - COMMITMENT FEE     3 - INTEREST     4 - CHARGESThe fourth digit indicates to whom the message is being generated, whether to the participant or to the borrower  or  to both.  Presently it has three values viz.  1 -  PARTICIPANT ONLY                             2 - PARTICIPANT AND BORROWER    3 - BORROWER ONLYFor example when a new loan is drawn down and message to be sent to borrower,  the activity generated would be SL-3103 meaning 3-LOAN, 1-INPUT, 0-OTHERS(since it involves all components) and 3-BORROWER.Validation Rules
