This defines the card type being issued and the card number involved.Contained in each record is the account number to which the card is being issued, the date of issue, any charges incurred at issue time and expiry date of the card.A charge entry may be raised for the issue depending on the charging structure defined for the card type on the CARD.CHARGE table. The system checks against account conditions and limits and will require overrides when appropriate.

 /* Defines the frequency at which periodic charges will be raised. The charge cycle defines when the end of day routine will raise periodic card charges. Charges will be activated when the date portion of this field is less than the next working day. Periodic charges will be raised on this date for all current cards of this type. A card is said to be current when: (a) The expiry date of the card is greater than the charge date, and (b) There is no cancellation date on the card issue record. The exception to the above rule depends on the CHARGE.FQU field and allows periodic charges to be raised at a frequency based on the original issue date of the card rather than the same date/frequency for all cards. This is explained with examples in the CHARGE.FQU field. 
        Example (a): All holders of Eurocheque cards are charged GBP 8.00 per year, in advance, for the use of their card. This charge is for the calendar year (i.e. from 1st January to 31st December) but is actually applied around the middle of January to minimise end of year processing. Fields on the CARD.CHARGE table are set as follows: 5 PERIODIC.CHARGE... 8.00 6 CHARGE.CYCLE...... 15 JAN 1992 M1215 7 CHARGE.FQU........ On 15th January 1992, the card issue file is selected for records with an expiry date later than this date (which selects only the current records) and with no cancellation date (which excludes any exceptions). Charges of GBP 8.00 are applied to each and the charge date is cycled forward to 15 JAN 1993. Because these cards may be issued at any time during the year, the period between issue and the first periodic charges is charged by entering an issue charge of GBP 8.00 as follows: 4 ISSUE.CHARGE...... 8.00 This is applied online when the card is issued and is effectively an advance charge for the remainder of the year. Consequently the bank may choose to reduce this at times during the year in order to discount the first years charges as the date approaches the end of the year. When a card is issued in the first two weeks of January this issue charge should be removed altogether, the correct charges will be applied for the year on the 15th. Example (b): The situation is similar to example (a) except there is an additional flat charge of GBP 5.00 for the issue of the card along with the GBP 8.00 for periodic usage. Fields are entered as follows: 4 ISSUE.CHARGE...... 13.00 5 PERIODIC.CHARGE... 8.00 6 CHARGE.CYCLE...... 15 JAN 1992 M1215 7 CHARGE.FQU........ On 15th January 1992 the identical selection to example (a) is made, i.e. all cards current at this date. They are each charged GBP 8.00 for the period 1st January 1992 to 31st December 1992. Cards issued during the year will each be charged online at GBP 13.00. This consists of the advance GBP 8.00 usage charge for the year ahead (which can be reduced as the year approaches its end) plus the GBP 5.00 issue charge. Thus during the first two weeks of January the issue charge would have been reduced to GBP 5.00. Validation Rules17 alphanumeric characters.  Standard date frequency field. */

 /* Specifies that the chargeable period for usage of cards is not the same as the periodic frequency on which charges are applied. This is intended to permit annual charging based on the anniversary of the issue of the card. This field allows charges to be raised periodically at a given frequency but based on the issue date of the card rather than a fixed date for all cards of this type. The best example is annual charging based on the date of issue of the card. 
        Example: Unlike Eurocheque cards which may all be charged on the same date yearly the bank may choose to issue its own credit card which expires at the end of the month two years after its issue date. Furthermore this card carries an annual usage charge of GBP 10.00 which is raised at the end of the month each year after issue. Thus this annual charge is applied once a month charging only those card holders whose cards were issued in the same month one year previously: 4 ISSUE.CHARGE...... 8.00 5 PERIODIC.CHARGE... 10.00 6 CHARGE.CYCLE...... 30 SEP 1991 M0131 7 CHARGE.FQU........ M1231 The CHARGE.FQU field in this case defines the period over which the charge will apply, ie yearly. On the 30th September 1991, the card issue file is selected for records with an expiry date later than this date and no cancellation date. The charging routine now makes an additional check based on the CHARGE.CYCLE frequency (monthly). Thus for the period from 30 SEP 1991 to 31 OCT 1991 charges will be raised at GBP 10.00 if: (a) If the anniversary of the issue date (or the issue date itself falls     within the charging period). (b) The expiry date falls later than this period. The anniversary is obtained by cycling forward the issue date according to the CHARGE.FQU (in this case 12 months). Validation Rules5 alphanumeric characters.  Standard frequency field. */
