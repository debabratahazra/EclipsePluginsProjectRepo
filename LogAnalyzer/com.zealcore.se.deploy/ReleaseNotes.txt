 KNOWN ISSUES
 
 Search and assertions with floating point values cause exceptions
  Example: Search for MeasureEvent with value 10.0 causes an exception.
  Workaround: Use the equal-operator if you are looking for an exact value. 
              Always use decimals, e.g. =10.0, >0.0 etc.
  
 The Common Log Format (1.0) does not support UML model and events
  Example: None of the supplied importers and files contains UML data
  Workaround: There is currently no workaround but to write your own importers and typepackage
