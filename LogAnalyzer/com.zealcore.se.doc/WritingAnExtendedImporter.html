<title>How to write an importer for the Optima Log Analyzer</title>

<h1>How to Write an Importer for the Optima Log Analyzer</h1>

<p>The Optima Log Analyzer provides an extension point called <tt>com.zealcore.se.core.extendedimporters</tt>
that it is possible to plug in to. The purpose of such an importer plugin is to read and parse log files of a
specified format. The extension point requires that the importer plugin implements an interface called
<tt>IExtendedImporter</tt>. The <tt>IExtendedImporter</tt> interface specifies six methods (see below).</p>


<h2>Selecting Binary or Text Log File Format</h2>
<p>In some cases it is possible to choose the format of the log
file that is to be imported, i.e. the tool that generates the log file can be
configured to generate binary or text log files. The difference between writing a binary importer
or a text importer is not that huge. Normally, a binary importer is faster than a
text importer, but during development it is often easier for the developer
to deal with text instead of binary data.</p>

<p>One of the issues to deal with when writing an importer is
how to identify the different parts of a log file; log events, event
properties, log file headers etc. Binary files normally have predefined or
queryable sizes for the different types of information.
Plain text files could often be parsed with regular expressions
(see the example importer) to distinguish between the different parts of the log file.
XML based log files are by nature simple to deal with, but often suffer from large file sizes.</p>

<h2>Terminology</h2>

<h3>Log Event</h3>
<p>A log event is a frequently used term in the Log Analyzer.
Each item that is logged is called a log event and can be of any type. Examples
of log events are <tt>send</tt>, <tt>receive</tt>, <tt>task switch</tt> etc.
It is up to the author of the importer to define the different types of log
events that an importer should be able to create. In the Log Analyzer, each log
event has at least a timestamp. It is possible to give a certain type of log event
any number of properties by defining a custom type description for it.</p>

<h3>Artifact</h3>
<p>An artifact is a piece of information that comes from a log file but where
the information is not related to any timescale. An example of an artifact is a
<tt>task</tt>. It is up to the author of the importer to define the different
types of artifacts that an importer should be able to create. In the Log Analyzer,
each artifact has at least an ID and a name. It is possible to give a certain type
of artifact any number of properties by defining a custom type description for it.</p>

<h3>Timestamp</h3>
<p>A timestamp is a given time connected to a log event. All
log events are sorted according to their timestamp. Internally in the Log Analyzer,
the unit for timestamps is nanoseconds (ns).</p>

<h3>Type Description</h3>
<p>Type descriptions can be used for defining custom types of log events and artifacts.
A type description defines the custom fields for a certain type of log event or artifact.</p>

<h2>Public Classes and Interfaces</h2>
<p>There is a number of classes and interfaces that are good to be familiar with in order
to be able to write an importer. The public classes and interfaces of the Log Analyzer are
described in this documentation, see the <i>API Specification</i> chapter. It is recommended
to take a look at the following classes and interfaces:</p>

</ul>

<h2>Writing the Importer</h2>

<h3>Prerequisites</h3>
<p>The importer plugin is preferably developed using Eclipse. To minimize version compatibility issues it is recommended 
to use the Log Analyzer Eclipse installation. This Eclipse installation needs to be 
upgraded with two additional components in order to develop Eclipse plugins; the Java Development Tools (JDT) and 
the Plugin Development Environment (PDE). To install these components, follow the steps below. The procedure
may vary since the structure of the Eclipse web site is not stable over time.</p>

<ol>
<li>Go to <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/">http://www.eclipse.org/</a> and follow the <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/">Downloads</a> link.</li>
<li>Under the "Eclipse Classic" section, follow the <a href="http://download.eclipse.org/eclipse/downloads/">Eclipse Project download page.</a></li>
<li>Select the same version as for the Log Analyzer Eclipse installation (see "Help -> About Log Analyzer" in the Log Analyzer Eclipse installation), e.g. 3.4.1.</li>
<li>Download the <i>JDT Runtime Binary</i>, e.g. <tt>eclipse-JDT-3.4.1.zip</tt>, and the <i>PDE Runtime Binary</i>, e.g. <tt>eclipse-PDE-3.4.1.zip</tt>.</li>
<li>Unzip the downloaded files into the Log Analyzer Eclipse installation.</li>
<li>Start the Log Analyzer with the <tt>-clean</tt> option.</li>
<li>The Log Analyzer is now upgraded to be able to develop Eclipse plugins.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Tutorial</h3>

<p>There is one supplied example importer that can be used for reference.</p>

<ul>
<li><tt><a href="SimpleExtendedImporter.html">SimpleExtendedImporter</a></tt>:
 This importer is a complete importer that reads text log files of a certain format. It 
 enables definition of task switches, send/receive events, and user events.</li>
</ul>

<p>This tutorial uses the <tt>SimpleExtendedImporter</tt> to illustrate how 
to write an importer plugin for the <tt>com.zealcore.se.core.extendedimporters</tt> extension point.</p>

<ol>
<li>Create a new empty Plugin Project with the project name "SimpleExtendedImporter".</li>
<li>Open the manifest file and click on the "Extensions" tab.</li>
<li>Click on the "Add" button to create an extension.</li>
<li>Uncheck the checkbox "Show only extension points from the required plugins".</li>
<li>Type "<tt>com.zealcore</tt>" in the "Extension Point filter".</li>
<li>Choose "<tt>com.zealcore.se.core.extendedimporters</tt>" from the list and click "Finish".</li>
<li>A dialog will appear with a question whether to add the required plugin to the list of plugin dependencies. Click "Yes".</li>
<li>Fill in id, class, and name in the "Extension Element Details" section and save the changes.</li>
<li>Click the highlighted "class*:" in the "Extension Element Details" to create the importer class.
    This will display the "New Class Wizard". Press "Finish" to continue.</li>
<li>This will result in an importer class, with code ready for modification. 
<li>Copy the source code from the <tt><a href="SimpleExtendedImporter.html">SimpleExtendedImporter</a></tt> example into your importer class.</li>
<li>Correct any name conflicts for the class name and package name.</li>
<li>Save the file and press "F11" to start debugging, select "Eclipse Application" if a dialog appear.</li>
<li>Select the Log Analyzer perspective.</li>
<li>Create a new Log Analyzer project.</li>
<li>Create a new file in the created logset and name the file <tt>data.log</tt>, and copy the example log file 
    contents that is found in the beginning of the example importer source code, into the file.</li>
<li>It is now possible to import the log file with the new importer.</li>
</ol>


<h3>Example Code</h3>

<p>The following methods can be derived from the <tt>IExtendedImporter</tt> interface.</p>

<b>canRead()</b><br/>
This method checks if the specified log file can be imported by this importer.<br/><br/>

<b>setContext()</b><br/>
This method sets the import context, which means that an import is being
performed and the importer will soon be asked for its events and artifacts.<br/><br/>

<b>getTypeDescriptions()</b><br/>
This method should return an iterator over all the custom type
descriptions for the events and artifacts in the log file. This
method can return the whole information at once.<br/><br/>

<b>getEvents()</b><br/>
This method should return an iterator over all the events in the log
file. This method should be implemented lazily, which means that all
events should not be read in advance. The events must be returned in
chronological order.<br/><br/>

<b>getArtifacts()</b><br/>
This method should return an iterator over all the artifacts in the
log file. This method should be implemented lazily, which means that
all artifacts should not be read in advance. Artifacts are not
necessarily referred to by the events.<br/><br/>

<b>toString()</b><br/>
Override the java.lang.Object.toString() method to return the name of the importer.<br/><br/>
