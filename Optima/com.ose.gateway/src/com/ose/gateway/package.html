This package contains the OSE Gateway API for Java, which provides a gateway
client in Java. The OSE gateway concept consists of a gateway client (typically
running on a host system) that communicates with a gateway server (typically
running on an OSE target system) using the OSE gateway protocol.
</p>

<p>
The OSE Gateway API for Java enables Java programs to communicate with remote
OSE processes using the OSE message-passing model for asynchronous interprocess
communication. In short, this means that Java programs can find OSE processes by
name, supervise OSE processes, send signals to OSE processes, and receive
signals from OSE processes.
