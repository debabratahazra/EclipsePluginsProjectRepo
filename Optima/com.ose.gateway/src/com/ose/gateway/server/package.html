<p>
This package contains the OSE Host Gateway Server API for Java. This API
supports two main use cases:
<ul>
<li>Writing host-based OSE-style services with signal interfaces. When using
this approach, your gateway service(s) should extend the abstract class
<code>AbstractGatewayService</code> and be registered with an instance of the
<code>GatewayServer</code> class.
<li>Writing a custom host gateway server that communicates with a custom target
gateway server for tunneling the TCP/IP-based OSE gateway protocol on top of
some other transport media, e.g. a serial connection. When using this approach,
you should extend the abstract classes <code>AbstractGatewayServer</code> and
<code>AbstractGatewayClient</code>.
</ul>
