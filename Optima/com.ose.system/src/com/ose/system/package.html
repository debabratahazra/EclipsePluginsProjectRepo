This package contains the OSE system model, which is a common system model for
the OSE family of operating systems; OSE Delta, OSEck, and OSE Epsilon. It
models OSE concepts like gates, targets, segments, pools, heaps, blocks, and
processes in an hierarchical tree structure. Some properties of the OSE system
model are specific to certain flavors of OSE, e.g. segments and blocks are only
applicable for OSE Delta systems. The OSE system model requires an OSE Gateway
connection to the OSE target and an OSE Monitor running on the target.
</p>

<p>
The OSE system model provides a thread-safe API to clients for accessing and
modifying the system model and an event listener interface for registering
interest in and receiving events when the system model is modified. All methods
in the OSE system model that modify its state take a progress monitor as
parameter for purpose of updating progress and responding to user cancellation.
</p>

<p>
The OSE system model separates updating (i.e. updating existing objects and
adding new objects) from cleaning (i.e. removing killed objects). When the
OSE system model finds out that an object has been killed, e.g. a process, it
marks that object as being killed but it will not remove it until a client
explicitly issues a clean-up operation.
</p>

<p>
The OSE system model depends on the OSE Gateway API for Java (com.ose.gateway)
and the Eclipse Core Runtime (org.eclipse.core.runtime). Since the system model
only depends on the Eclipse Core Runtime and no other parts of Eclipse, it can
be used outside of the Eclipse IDE.
